Colorado is part of the [[Western United States]], the [[Southwestern United States]], and the [[Mountain States]]. Colorado is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|8th most extensive]] and the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population|22nd most populous]] of the [[50 United States]]. The [[United States Census Bureau]] estimates that the population of Colorado was 5,268,367 on July 1, 2013, an increase of 4.76% since the [[2010 United States Census]].&lt;ref name=PopEstUS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/popest/data/state/totals/2013/tables/NST-EST2013-01.xls|title=Table 1.

The state was named for the [[Colorado River]], which [[Conquistador#North America exploration|Spanish explorers]] named the ''RĂ­o Colorado'' for the [[Wiktionary:ruddy|ruddy]] ({{lang-es|[[Wiktionary:colorado|colorado]]}}) silt the river carried from the mountains. On August 1, 1876, [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Ulysses S. Grant]] signed a proclamation admitting Colorado to the [[United States|Union]] as the 38th state. Colorado is nicknamed the &quot;[[List of U.S. state nicknames|Centennial State]]&quot; because it became a state in the [[century|centennial year]] of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]].

Colorado is bordered by the [[Northwestern United States|northwest]] state of [[Wyoming]] to the north, the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] states of [[Nebraska]] and [[Kansas]] to the northeast and east, on the south by [[New Mexico]] and [[Oklahoma]], on the west by [[Utah]], and [[Arizona]] to the southwest. The four states of Colorado, [[New Mexico]], [[Utah]], and [[Arizona]] meet at one common point known as the [[Four Corners]], which is known as the heart of the [[Southwestern United States|American Southwest]]. Colorado is noted for its vivid landscape of mountains, forests, [[High Plains (United States)|high plains]], [[mesa]]s, [[canyon]]s, [[plateau]]s, rivers, and [[Desert|desert lands]].

[[Denver]] is the capital and the [[Colorado municipalities by population|most populous city]] of Colorado. Residents of the state are properly known as &quot;[[List of demonyms for U.S. states|Coloradans]]&quot;, although the archaic term &quot;Coloradoan&quot; is still used, albeit rarely.&lt;ref name=statestyle&gt;[http://ccs.colostate.edu/style_guide/style_guide_az.aspx#state_names Writers Style Guide], Colorado State University.

==Geography==
{{main|Geography of Colorado}}
Colorado is notable for its diverse geography, ranging from alpine mountains, arid plains and deserts with huge sand dunes, deep canyons, sandstone and granite rock formations, rivers, lakes, and lush forests. 
The borders of Colorado were originally defined to be lines of latitude and longitude, making its shape a latitude-longitude* quadrangle which stretches from [[37th parallel north|37Â°N]] to [[41st parallel north|41Â°N]] latitude and from [[25th meridian west from Washington|102Â°03'W]] to [[32nd meridian west from Washington|109Â°03'W]] longitude ([[25th meridian west from Washington|25Â°W]] to [[32nd meridian west from Washington|32Â°W]] from the [[Washington Meridian]]).&lt;ref name=Colorado_Enabling_Act/&gt; Colorado, [[Wyoming]] and [[Utah]] are the only states which have boundaries defined solely by lines of latitude and longitude. When placing the border markers for the [[Territory of Colorado]], minor [[surveying]] errors resulted in several &lt;!-- nearly imperceptible --&gt;small kinks, most notably along the [http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&amp;ll=38.258671,-108.873138&amp;spn=0.731113,1.235962&amp;z=10 border] with the [[Territory of Utah]]. Once agreed upon by the federal, state, and territorial governments, those [[benchmark (surveying)|surveyors' benchmarks]] became the legal boundaries for the Colorado Territory, kinks and all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maa.org/mathtourist/mathtourist_08_30_07.html |title=Rectangular States and Kinky Borders |publisher=Maa.org |date=August 30, 2007 |accessdate=July 30, 2010}}{{dead link|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mountains===
{{See also|Mountain peaks of Colorado}}
Colorado is also known as &quot;The [[Switzerland]] of America&quot;. The summit of [[Mount Elbert]] at {{convert|14440|ft|0}} in elevation in [[Lake County, Colorado|Lake County]] is the highest point of Colorado and the Rocky Mountains.&lt;ref name=Mount_Elbert&gt;{{cite ngs|id=KL0637|designation=Mount Elbert|accessdate=October 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colorado is the only U.S. state that lies entirely above {{convert|1000|m|0|sp=us}} elevation. The point where the [[Arikaree River]] flows out of [[Yuma County, Colorado]], and into [[Cheyenne County, Kansas]], is the lowest point in Colorado at {{convert|3317|ft|0}} elevation. This point, which holds the distinction of being the highest low elevation point of any state,&lt;ref name=USGS&gt;{{cite web| date = April 29, 2005| url = http://erg.usgs.gov/isb/pubs/booklets/elvadist/elvadist.html#Highest| title = Elevations and Distances in the United States| publisher = U.S. Geological Survey| accessdate =October 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=U.S. Geological Survey |title=Elevations and Distances |url=http://erg.usgs.gov/isb/pubs/booklets/elvadist/elvadist.html#Highest |accessdate=September 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; is higher than the high elevation points of 18 states and the District of Columbia.

[[File:Calhanpm.JPG|thumb|left|The Calhan Paint Mines on the Colorado Eastern Plains]]

===Plains===
A little less than one half of the area of Colorado is flat and rolling land. East of the Rocky Mountains are the [[Colorado Eastern Plains]] of the [[High Plains (United States)|High Plains]], the section of the Great Plains within Nebraska at elevations ranging from roughly {{convert|3350|to|7500|ft|m}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.summitpost.org/colorado-county-highpoints/532245|title=Colorado County Highpoints|accessdate=February 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Colorado plains are usually thought of as [[prairie]]s, but actually they have many patches of [[deciduous forests]], [[butte]]s, and [[canyons]], much like the high plains in New Mexico as well. Eastern Colorado is presently mainly covered in farmland, along with small farming villages and towns. [[Precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] is fair, averaging from {{convert|15|to|25|in|mm}} annually.&lt;ref name=ccc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccc.atmos.colostate.edu/climateofcolorado.php|title=Climate of Colorado|last=Doesken|first=Nolan J.|coauthors=[[Roger A. Pielke]], Sr., Odilia A.P. Bliss|date=January 2003|publisher=Colorado Climate Center â€“ Department of Atmospheric Science â€“ [[Colorado State University]]|accessdate=January 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[maize|Corn]], wheat, [[hay]], [[soybeans]], and [[oats]] are all typical crops, and most of the villages and towns in this region boast both a [[water tower]] and a [[grain elevator]]. As well as the farming of crops, Eastern Colorado has a good deal of livestock raising, such as at cattle ranches and [[Intensive pig farming|hog farms]] and [[irrigation]] water is available from the South Platte, the Arkansas River, and a few other streams, and also from subterranean sources, including [[artesian well]]s. However, heavy use of ground water from wells for irrigation has caused underground water reserves to decline.
[[File:Condiv.JPG|thumb|[[Front Range]] Peaks west of Denver]]

===Front range===
Most of Colorado's population resides along the eastern edge of the Rocky Mountains in the [[Front Range Urban Corridor]] between [[Cheyenne, Wyoming]], and [[Pueblo, Colorado]]. This region is partially protected from prevailing storms that blow in from the Pacific Ocean region by the high Rockies in the middle of Colorado. The only other significant population centers are at [[Grand Junction, Colorado|Grand Junction]] and [[Durango, Colorado|Durango]] in western and southwestern Colorado, respectively.

===Continental Divide===
The [[Continental Divide]] extends along the crest of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. The area of Colorado to the west of the Continental Divide is called the [[Colorado Western Slope|Western Slope of Colorado]]. Drainage water west of the Continental Divide flows to the southwest via the [[Colorado River (U.S.)|Colorado River]] and the [[Green River (Utah)|Green River]] into the [[Gulf of California]].

Within the interior of the Rocky Mountains are several large so-called &quot;parks&quot; or high broad basins. In the north, on the east side of the Continental Divide is the [[North Park (Colorado basin)|North Park of Colorado]]. The North Park is drained by the [[North Platte River]], which flows north into Wyoming and Nebraska. Just to the south of North Park, but on the western side of the Continental Divide, is the [[Middle Park (Colorado basin)|Middle Park of Colorado]], which is drained by the Colorado River. The [[South Park (Park County, Colorado)|South Park of Colorado]] is the region of the [[headwater]]s of the South Platte River.

===Southern region===
[[File:Mt Herard sand.JPG|thumb|left|The tallest dunes in North America at [[Great Sand Dunes National Park]] in southern Colorado]]
In southmost Colorado is the large [[San Luis Valley]], where the headwaters of the [[Rio Grande]] are located. The valley sits between the [[Sangre De Cristo Mountains]] and [[San Juan Mountains]], and consists of large desert lands that eventually run into the mountains. The Rio Grande drains due south into New Mexico, Mexico, and Texas. Across the [[Sangre de Cristo Range]] to the east of the San Luis Valley lies the [[Wet Mountain Valley]]. These basins, particularly the San Luis Valley, lie along the [[Rio Grande Rift]], a major [[geological formation]] of the Rocky Mountains, and its branches.
[[File:ChicoClosedBasin.jpg|thumb|right|The high desert lands that make up the San Luis Valley in Southern Colorado]]

===Peaks===
To the west of the Great Plains of Colorado rises the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains. Notable peaks of the Rocky Mountains include [[Longs Peak]], [[Mount Evans]], [[Pikes Peak]], and the [[Spanish Peaks]] near [[Walsenburg, Colorado|Walsenburg]], in southern Colorado. This area drains to the east and the southeast, ultimately either via the [[Mississippi River]] or the [[Rio Grande]] into the [[Gulf of Mexico]].
[[File:SANJUANMTNS.JPG|thumb|Peaks of the [[San Juan Mountains]]]]

The Rocky Mountains within Colorado contain about 54 peaks that are {{convert|14000|ft|m|0|sp=us}} or higher in elevation above sea level, known as [[Colorado fourteeners|fourteeners]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=U.S. Forest Service|title=Rocky Mountain Region 14ers |url=http://www.fs.fed.us/r2/recreation/14ers/ |accessdate=November 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; These mountains are largely covered with trees such as [[conifer]]s and [[aspen]]s up to the [[tree line]], at an elevation of about {{convert|12140|ft|m|0|sp=us}} in southern Colorado to about {{convert|10500|ft|m|0|sp=us}} in northern Colorado. Above this only alpine vegetation grows. Only small parts of the Colorado Rockies are snow-covered year round.

Much of the alpine snow melts by mid-August with the exception of a few snowcapped peaks and a few small glaciers. The [[Colorado Mineral Belt]], stretching from the [[San Juan Mountains]] in the southwest to [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]] and [[Central City, Colorado|Central City]] on the front range, contains most of the historic gold- and silver-mining districts of Colorado. [[Mount Elbert]] is the highest summit of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. The 30 [[Highest mountain peaks of the Rocky Mountains|highest major summits]] of the [[Rocky Mountains]] of North America all lie within the state.

===Colorado Western Slope===
[[File:Grand Valley, Colorado.jpg|thumb|left|The Grand Valley is Western Colorado, a large valley made up of high desert terrain. The city of Grand Junction is located in the heart of the valley]]
The Western Slope of Colorado is drained by the Colorado River and its tributaries (primarily the [[Green River (Utah)|Green River]] and the [[San Juan River (Colorado River)|San Juan River]]), or by evaporation in its arid areas. Prominent in the southwestern area of the Western Slope is the [[Grand Mesa]] and the high San Juan Mountains, a rugged mountain range, and to the west of the San Juan Mountains, the [[Colorado Plateau]], a high arid region that borders Southern Utah. The Colorado River flows through Glenwood Canyon and then through an arid valley made up of desert from [[Rifle, Colorado|Rifle]] to [[Parachute, Colorado|Parachute]], through the desert canyon of [[De Beque Canyon]], and into the arid desert of [[Grand Valley (Colorado)|Grand Valley]], of which the city of Grand Junction is located.

The city of [[Grand Junction, Colorado]], is the largest city on the Western Slope, Grand Junction and Durango are the only major centers of [[television broadcasting]] west of the Continental Divide in Colorado. Most mountain resort communities publish daily newspapers. Higher education on the Western Slope can be found at [[Colorado Mesa University]] in Grand Junction, [[Western State College of Colorado]] in Gunnison, [[Fort Lewis College]] in Durango and [[Colorado Mountain College]] in Glenwood Springs and Steamboat Springs.

Grand Junction is located along [[Interstate 70 in Colorado|Interstate 70]], the only major highway of Western Colorado. Grand Junction is also along the major railroad of the Western Slope, the [[Union Pacific]], which also provides the tracks for [[Amtrak]]'s [[California Zephyr]] passenger train, which crosses the Rocky Mountains between Denver and Grand Junction via a route on which there are no continuous highways.

[[File:Colorado National Monument (4939640266).jpg|thumb|right|The Colorado National Monument near Grand Junction. The monument is made up of high desert canyons and sandstone rock formations]]

To the southeast of Grand Junction is the [[Grand Mesa]], said to be the world's largest flat-topped mountain. Other towns of the Western Slope include [[Glenwood Springs, Colorado|Glenwood Springs]] with its resort hot springs, and the [[ski resort]]s of [[Aspen, Colorado|Aspen]], [[Breckenridge, Colorado|Breckenridge]], [[Vail, Colorado|Vail]], [[Crested Butte, Colorado|Crested Butte]], [[Steamboat Springs, Colorado|Steamboat Springs]], and [[Telluride, Colorado|Telluride]].

The northwestern corner of Colorado is a sparsely populated region, and it contains part of the noted [[Dinosaur National Monument]], which is not only a [[paleontology|paleontological]] area, but is also a scenic area of rocky hills, canyons, arid desert, and streambeads. Here, the Green River briefly crosses over into Colorado.

From west to east, the land of Colorado consists of desert lands, desert plateaus, alpine mountains, National Forests, relatively flat grasslands, scattered forests, buttes, and canyons in the western edge of the [[Great Plains]]. The famous [[Pikes Peak]] is located just west of [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]]. Its isolated peak is visible from nearly the Kansas border on clear days, and also far to the north and the south.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite peakbagger |pid=5689 |name=Pikes Peak, Colorado |accessdate=October 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The desert lands in Colorado are located in and around areas such as, the [[Pueblo, Colorado|Pueblo]], [[Canon City, Colorado|Canon City]], [[Florence, Colorado|Florence]], [[Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve]], [[San Luis Valley]], [[Cortez, Colorado|Cortez]], [[Canyon of the Ancients National Monument]], [[Hovenweep National Monument]], [[Ute Mountain]], [[Delta, Colorado|Delta]], [[Grand Junction, Colorado|Grand Junction]], [[Colorado National Monument]], and other areas surrounding the [[Uncompahgre Plateau]] and [[Uncompahgre National Forest]].

[[File:Four Corners Monument (1).jpg|thumb|The [[Four Corners Monument]], with [[Ute Mountain]] in the distance]]
Colorado is one of four states in the United States that share a common geographic point the [[Four Corners]] together with Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah. At this intersection, it is possible to stand in four states at once.

==Climate==
The [[climate]] of Colorado is more complex than states outside of the [[Mountain States]] region. Unlike most other states, southern Colorado is not always warmer than northern Colorado. Most of Colorado is made up of mountains, foothills, high plains, and desert lands. Mountains and surrounding valleys greatly affect local climate.

As a general rule, with an increase in elevation comes a decrease in temperature and an increase in [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]]. Northeast, east, and southeast Colorado are mostly the high plains, while Northern Colorado is a mix of high plains, foothills, and mountains. Northwest and west Colorado are predominantly mountainous, with some desert lands mixed in. Southwest and southern Colorado are a complex mixture of desert and mountain areas.

===Eastern Plains===
[[File:PivotWithDrops.JPG|thumb|[[Center pivot irrigation|Center-pivot irrigation]] of wheat growing in [[Yuma County, Colorado|Yuma County]]]]

The climate of the Eastern Plains is [[semi-arid climate|semiarid]] ([[KĂ¶ppen climate classification]]: [[Cold semi-arid climate|''BSk'']]) with low [[humidity]] and moderate [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], usually from {{convert|15|to|25|in|mm|abbr=on}} annually. The area is known for its abundant sunshine and cool, clear nights, which give this area a great average [[diurnal temperature variation|diurnal temperature range]]. The difference between the highs of the days and the lows of the nights can be considerable as warmth dissipates to the space during clear nights, the heat radiation not being trapped by clouds.

In summer, this area can have many days above 95&amp;nbsp;Â°F (35&amp;nbsp;Â°C) and often 100&amp;nbsp;Â°F (38&amp;nbsp;Â°C).&lt;ref name=&quot;Climate of Colorado&quot;&gt;[http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/narratives/COLORADO.htm DRI.edu] Western Regional Climate Center. Retrieved October 24, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; On the plains, the winter lows usually range from 25 to â’10&amp;nbsp;Â°F (â’4 to â’23&amp;nbsp;Â°C). About 75% of the precipitation falls within the growing season, from April to September, but this area is very prone to droughts. Most of the precipitation comes from [[thunderstorm]]s, which can be severe, and from major [[snowstorm]]s that occur in the winter and early spring. Otherwise, winters tend to be mostly dry and cold.&lt;ref name=&quot;Denver-Colorado-United-States-of-America&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=096427&amp;refer=&amp;cityname=Denver-Colorado-United-States-of-America|title=Denver, Colorado Travel Weather Averages|publisher=Weatherbase |accessdate=July 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In much of the region, March is the snowiest month. April and May are normally the rainiest months, while April is the wettest month overall. The Front Range cities closer to the mountains tend to be warmer in the winter due to [[chinook wind]]s which warm the area, sometimes bringing temperatures of 70&amp;nbsp;Â°F or higher in the winter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Denver-Colorado-United-States-of-America&quot; /&gt; The average July temperature is 55&amp;nbsp;Â°F (13&amp;nbsp;Â°C) in the morning and 90&amp;nbsp;Â°F (32&amp;nbsp;Â°C) in the afternoon. The average January temperature is 1&amp;nbsp;Â°F (â’8&amp;nbsp;Â°C) in the morning and 48&amp;nbsp;Â°F (9&amp;nbsp;Â°C) in the afternoon, although variation between consecutive days can be 40&amp;nbsp;Â°F (4&amp;nbsp;Â°C).

===West of the plains and foothills===
West of the plains and foothills, the weather of Colorado is much less uniform. Even places a few miles apart can experience entirely different weather depending on the topography of the area. Most valleys have a semi-arid climate, which becomes an [[alpine climate]] at higher elevations. Humid [[microclimate]]s also exist in some areas. Generally, the wettest season in western Colorado is winter while June is the driest month.

The mountains have mild summers with many days of high temperatures between 60 and 85&amp;nbsp;Â°F (16 and 29&amp;nbsp;Â°C),  although thunderstorms can cause sudden but brief drops in temperature. The winters bring abundant, powdery snowfall to the mountains with plenty of sunshine between major storms. The western slope has high summer temperatures similar to those found on the plains, while the winters tend to be slightly cooler due to the lack of warming winds common to the plains and Front Range. Other areas in the west have their own unique climate.

===Extreme weather===
[[File:October Snow in Colorado.jpg|thumb|Snow highlights the rugged mountains, as well as the urban and agricultural landscapes of the Colorado plains.]]

Extreme weather changes are common in Colorado, although the majority of extreme weather occurs in the least populated areas of the state. Thunderstorms are common east of the Continental Divide in the spring and summer, yet are usually brief. [[Hail]] is a common sight in the mountains east of the divide and in the northwest part of the state. The Eastern Plains have had some of the biggest hail storms in North America.&lt;ref name=ccc/&gt;

The Eastern Plains are part of the extreme western portion of [[Tornado Alley]]; some damaging tornadoes in the Eastern Plains include the 1990 [[Limon, Colorado|Limon]] [[Fujita scale|F3]] tornado and the 2008 [[Windsor, Colorado|Windsor]] [[Enhanced Fujita Scale|EF3]] tornado, which devastated the small town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The plains are also susceptible to occasional floods, which are caused both by [[thunderstorm]]s and by the rapid melting of snow in the mountains during warm weather. Denver's record in 1901 for the number of consecutive days above  90&amp;nbsp;Â°F (32&amp;nbsp;Â°C) was broken during the summer of 2008. The new record of 24 consecutive days surpassed the previous record by almost a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Much of Colorado is a very dry state averaging only {{convert|17|in|mm|abbr=on}} of precipitation per year statewide and rarely experiences a time when some portion of the state is not in some degree of drought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccc.atmos.colostate.edu/pdfs/ahistoryofdrought.pdf|title=A History of Drought|format=PDF |accessdate=July 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of precipitation contributes to the severity of [[wildfire]]s in the state, such as the [[Hayman Fire]], one of the largest wildfires in American history, and the [[Fourmile Canyon#Fourmile Canyon Fire|Fourmile Canyon Fire]] of 2010, which until the [[Waldo Canyon Fire]] of June 2012, and the [[Black Forest Fire]] about a year later, was the most destructive wildfire in Colorado's recorded history.

However, some of the mountainous regions of Colorado receive a huge amount of moisture from winter snowfalls. The spring melts of these snows often cause great waterflows in the [[Yampa River]], the [[Colorado River]], the Rio Grande, the Arkansas River, [[Cherry Creek (Colorado)|Cherry Creek]], the North Platte River, and the South Platte River.
[[File:Overlook of Yampa River.jpg|thumb|250px|The Yampa River, from a high overlook]]

Water flowing out of the Colorado Rocky Mountains is a very significant source of water for the farms, towns, and cities of the southwest states of New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, and Nevada, as well as the Midwest, such as Nebraska and Kansas, and the southern states of Oklahoma and Texas. A significant amount of water is also diverted for use in California; occasionally (formerly naturally and consistently), the flow of water reaches northern Mexico.

===Records===
The highest ambient air temperature ever recorded in Colorado was {{convert|118|Â°F|Â°C}} on July 11, 1888, at [[Bennett, Colorado|Bennett]]. The lowest air temperature was {{convert|-61|Â°F|Â°C}} on February 1, 1985, at [[Maybell, Colorado|Maybell]].&lt;ref name=StateMaxTemps&gt;{{cite web| url = http://lwf.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/pub/data/special/maxtemps.pdf| title = Record Highest Temperatures by State | format = PDF | publisher = [[National Climatic Data Center]] | date = January 1, 2004 | accessdate =January 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=StateMinTemps&gt;{{cite web | url = http://lwf.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/pub/data/special/mintemps.pdf | title = Record Lowest Temperatures by State | format = PDF | publisher = [[National Climatic Data Center]] | date = January 1, 2004 | accessdate =January 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|History of Colorado|Timeline of Colorado history}}
The region that is today the state of Colorado has been inhabited by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] for more than 13,000 years. The [[Lindenmeier Site]] in [[Larimer County, Colorado|Larimer County]] contains [[artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] dating from approximately 11200 BC to 3000 BC. The eastern edge of the [[Rocky Mountains]] was a [[Human migration|major migration route]] that was important to the spread of early peoples throughout the Americas. The [[Ancient Pueblo peoples]] lived in the [[valley]]s and [[mesa]]s of the [[Colorado Plateau]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://news.discovery.com/archaeology/genocide-native-americans-ethnic-cleansing.html Genocide Wiped Out Native American Population ]&quot;, Discovery News, September 20, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ute Nation]] inhabited the mountain valleys of the [[Southern Rocky Mountains]] and the [[Western Rocky Mountains]], even as far east as the Front Range of present day. The [[Apache]] and the [[Comanche]] also inhabited Eastern and Southeastern parts of the state. At times, the [[Arapaho Nation]] and the [[Cheyenne Nation]] moved west to hunt across the [[High Plains (United States)|High Plains]].

The U.S. acquired a territorial claim to the eastern Rocky Mountains with the [[Louisiana Purchase]] from France in 1803. This U.S. claim conflicted with the claim by [[Spain]] to the upper [[Arkansas River|Arkansas River Basin]] as the exclusive trading zone of its colony of [[Santa FĂ© de Nuevo MĂ©jico]].  In 1806, [[Zebulon Pike]] led a [[Pike expedition|U.S. Army reconnaissance expedition]] into the disputed region. Colonel Pike and his men were arrested by Spanish cavalrymen in the [[San Luis Valley]] the following February, taken to [[Chihuahua, Chihuahua|Chihuahua]], and expelled from Mexico the following July.

The U.S. relinquished its claim to all land south and west of the [[Arkansas River]] and south of [[42nd parallel north]] and west of the [[100th meridian west]] as part of its purchase of Florida from Spain with the [[Adams-OnĂ­s Treaty]] of 1819. The treaty took effect February 22, 1821. Having settled its border with Spain, the U.S. admitted the southeastern portion of the [[Territory of Missouri]] to the [[United States|Union]] as the [[state of Missouri]] on August 10, 1821. The remainder of Missouri Territory, including what would become northeastern Colorado, became unorganized territory, and remained so for 33 years over the [[Slavery in the United States|question of slavery]]. After 11 years of war, Spain finally recognized the independence of Mexico with the [[Treaty of CĂłrdoba]] signed on August 24, 1821. Mexico eventually ratified the Adams-OnĂ­s Treaty in 1831. The [[Texian Revolt]] of 1835â€“1836 fomented a dispute between the U.S. and Mexico which eventually erupted into the [[Mexican-American War]] in 1846. Mexico surrendered its northern territory to the U.S. with the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] at the conclusion of the war in 1848.

Most American [[settler]]s traveling overland west to the [[Oregon Country]], namely the new goldfields of California, or the new [[Mormon]] settlements of the [[State of Deseret]] in the [[Salt Lake Valley]], avoided the rugged [[Southern Rocky Mountains]], and instead followed the [[North Platte River]] and [[Sweetwater River (Wyoming)|Sweetwater River]] to [[South Pass (Wyoming)]], the lowest crossing of the [[Continental Divide]] between the Southern Rocky Mountains and the Central Rocky Mountains. In 1849, the Mormons of the Salt Lake Valley organized the extralegal [[State of Deseret]], claiming the entire [[Great Basin]] and all lands drained by the rivers [[Green River (Utah)|Green]], [[Colorado River|Grand]], and [[Colorado River|Colorado]]. The federal government of the U.S. flatly refused to recognize the new Mormon government, because it was [[History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints#Brigham Young's early theocratic leadership|theocratic]] and sanctioned [[Mormonism and polygamy|plural marriage]]. Instead, the [[Compromise of 1850]] divided the [[Mexican Cession]] and the northwestern claims of Texas into a new state and two new territories, the [[state of California]], the [[Territory of New Mexico]], and the [[Territory of Utah]]. On April 9, 1851, [[Mexican American]] settlers from the area of [[Taos, New Mexico|Taos]] settled the village of [[San Luis, Colorado|San Luis]], then in the [[New Mexico Territory]], later to become Colorado's first permanent [[European American|Euro-American]] [[settlement (migration)|settlement]].

In 1854, Senator [[Stephen A. Douglas]] persuaded the [[U.S. Congress]] to divide the unorganized territory east of the [[Continental Divide]] into two new organized territories, the [[Territory of Kansas]] and the [[Territory of Nebraska]], and an unorganized southern region known as the [[Indian territory]]. Each new territory was to decide the fate of slavery within its boundaries, but this compromise merely served to fuel animosity between [[free soil]] and [[Proslavery in the antebellum United States|pro-slavery]] factions.

The gold seekers organized the [[Jefferson Territory|Provisional Government of the Territory of Jefferson]] on August 24, 1859, but this new territory failed to secure approval from the [[Congress of the United States]] embroiled in the debate over slavery. The election of [[Abraham Lincoln]] for the President of the United States on November 6, 1860, led to the [[secession]] of nine southern [[slave states]] and the threat of [[American Civil War|civil war among the states]]. Seeking to augment the political power of the [[free state (United States)|Union states]], the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] dominated Congress quickly admitted the eastern portion of the [[Territory of Kansas]] into the [[United States|Union]] as the free [[Kansas|State of Kansas]] on January 29, 1861, leaving the western portion of the Kansas Territory, and its gold-mining areas, as unorganized territory.

Thirty days later on February 28, 1861, outgoing U.S. President [[James Buchanan]] signed an Act of Congress organizing the [[Free state (United States)|free]] [[Territory of Colorado]].&lt;ref name=ColoradoTerritory&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.colorado.gov/dpa/doit/archives/territory.pdf | title = An Act to provide a temporary Government for the Territory of Colorado | format = PDF | publisher = [[Thirty-sixth United States Congress]] | date = February 28, 1861 | accessdate =June 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original boundaries of Colorado remain unchanged today. The name Colorado was chosen because it was commonly believed that the [[Colorado River]] originated in the territory.&lt;ref name=Colorado_River&gt;Early explorers identified the [[Gunnison River]] in Colorado as the [[headwaters]] of the Colorado River. The [[Colorado River|Grand River]] in Colorado was later tentively identified as the primary headwaters of the river. Finally in 1916, [[E.C. LaRue]], the Chief Hydrologist of the [[United States Geological Survey]], identified the Green River in southwestern Wyoming as the proper headwaters of the actual, overall Colorado River.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1776, Spanish priest [[Silvestre VĂ©lez de Escalante]] recorded that [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] in the area knew the river as ''[[:es:Rio Colorado|el Rio Colorado]]'' for the red-brown silt that the river carried from the mountains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=State of Colorado â€“ Division of Information Technologies |url=http://www.colorado.gov/dpa/doit/archives/history/symbemb.htm#Name|title=State Names and Nicknames |accessdate=November 15, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1859, a [[U.S. Army]] [[Topography|topographic]] expedition led by Captain [[John Navarre Macomb, Jr.|John Macomb]] located the confluence of the [[Green River (Utah)|Green River]] with the [[Grand River (Colorado)|Grand River]] in what is now [[Canyonlands National Park]] in [[Utah]].&lt;ref name=Macomb&gt;Report of the exploring expedition from Santa FĂ©, New Mexico, to the junction of the Grand and Green Rivers of the great Colorado of the West, in 1859: under the command of Capt.

On April 12, 1861, [[South Carolina]] artillery opened fire on [[Fort Sumter]] to start the [[American Civil War]]. While many gold seekers held sympathies for the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], the vast majority remained fiercely loyal to the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] cause.

In 1862, a force of Texas cavalry invaded the [[Territory of New Mexico]] and captured [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] on March 10. The object of this [[New Mexico Campaign|Western Campaign]] was to seize or disrupt the gold fields of Colorado and California and to seize ports on the Pacific Ocean for the Confederacy. A hastily organized force of Colorado volunteers force-marched from [[Denver City, Colorado Territory]], to [[Glorieta Pass]], New Mexico Territory, in an attempt to block the Texans. On March 28, the Coloradans and local New Mexico volunteers stopped the Texans at the [[Battle of Glorieta Pass]], destroyed their cannon and supply wagons, and ran off 500 of their horses and mules. The Texans were forced to retreat to Santa Fe. Having lost the supplies for their campaign and finding little support in New Mexico, the Texans abandoned Santa Fe and returned to [[San Antonio]] in defeat. The Confederacy made no further attempts to seize the Southwestern United States.

In 1864, [[Governor of Colorado|Territorial Governor]] [[John Evans (governor)|John Evans]] appointed the Reverend [[John Chivington]] as Colonel of the Colorado Volunteers with orders to protect white settlers from [[Cheyenne]] and [[Arapaho]] warriors who were accused of stealing cattle. Colonel Chivington ordered his men to attack a band of Cheyenne and Arapaho encamped along Sand Creek. Chivington reported that his troops killed more than 500 warriors. The militia returned to Denver City in triumph, but several officers reported that the so-called battle was a blatant massacre of Indians at peace, that most of the dead were women and children, and that bodies of the dead had been hideously mutilated and desecrated. Three U.S. Army inquiries condemned the action, and incoming [[U.S. President|President]] [[Andrew Johnson]] asked Governor Evans for his resignation, but none of the perpetrators was ever punished. This event is now known as the [[Sand Creek massacre]].

In the midst and aftermath of Civil War, many discouraged prospectors returned to their homes, but a few stayed and developed mines, mills, farms, ranches, roads, and towns in Colorado Territory. On September 14, 1864, James Huff discovered silver near [[Argentine Pass]], the first of many silver strikes. In 1867, the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] laid its tracks west to [[Julesburg, Colorado|Weir]], now [[Julesburg, Colorado|Julesburg]], in the northeast corner of the Territory. The Union Pacific linked up with the [[Central Pacific Railroad]] at [[Promontory Summit, Utah]], on May 10, 1869, to form the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]]. The [[Denver Pacific Railway]] reached Denver in June the following year, and the [[Kansas Pacific]] arrived two months later to forge the second line across the continent. In 1872, rich veins of silver were discovered in the [[San Juan Mountains]] on the [[Ute tribe|Ute Indian]] reservation in southwestern Colorado. The Ute people were removed from the San Juans the following year.

The [[United States Congress]] passed an enabling act on March 3, 1875, specifying the requirements for the [[Territory of Colorado]] to become a state.&lt;ref name=Colorado_Enabling_Act&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.i2i.org/Publications/ColoradoConstitution/cnenable.htm|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20080507151300/http://www.i2i.org/Publications/ColoradoConstitution/cnenable.htm|archivedate=May 7, 2008|title=An Act to Enable the People of Colorado to Form a Constitution and State Government, and for the Admission of the Said State into the Union on an Equal Footing with the Original States|format=PDF|author=[[Forty-third United States Congress]]|date=March 3, 1875|accessdate=April 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 1, 1876 (28 days after the [[Centennial of the United States]]), U.S. President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] signed a proclamation admitting Colorado to the [[United States|Union]] as the [[U.S. state|38th state]] and earning it the moniker &quot;Centennial State&quot;.&lt;ref name=Colorado_Statehood_Proclamation&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=70540|title=Proclamation of the Admission of Colorado to the Union|format=[[php]]|author=President of the United States of America|date=August 1, 1876|publisher=The American Presidency Project|accessdate=April 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discovery of a major silver lode near [[Leadville, Colorado|Leadville]] in 1878 triggered the [[Colorado Silver Boom]]. The [[Sherman Silver Purchase Act]] of 1890 invigorated silver mining, and Colorado's last, but greatest, gold strike at [[Cripple Creek, Colorado|Cripple Creek]] a few months later lured a new generation of gold seekers. Colorado women were granted the [[suffrage|right to vote]] beginning on November 7, 1893, making Colorado the second state to grant [[universal suffrage]] and the first one by a [[popular vote]] (of Colorado men). The repeal of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act in 1893 led to a staggering collapse of the mining and agricultural economy of Colorado, but the state slowly and steadily recovered.

Colorado became the first western state to host a major political convention when the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] met in Denver in 1908. By the [[United States Census, 1930|U.S. Census in 1930]], the population of Colorado first exceeded one million residents. Colorado suffered greatly through the [[Great Depression]] and the [[Dust Bowl]] of the 1930s, but a major wave of immigration following World War II boosted Colorado's fortune. Tourism became a mainstay of the state economy, and high technology became an important economic engine. The [[United States Census Bureau]] estimated that the population of Colorado exceeded five million in 2009.

Three [[warship]]s of the [[U.S. Navy]] have been named the USS ''[[USS Colorado|Colorado]]''. The first USS ''Colorado'' was named for the Colorado River. The later two ships were named in honor of the state, including the [[battleship]] USS ''[[USS Colorado (BB-45)|Colorado]]'' which served in [[War in the Pacific|World War II in the Pacific]] beginning in 1941. At the time of the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]], this USS ''Colorado'' was located at the naval base in San Diego, Calif. and hence went unscathed.

People of [[Hispanic and Latino American]] (of any race made) heritage, made up 20.7% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=DEC_10_DP_DPDP1&amp;prodType=table&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 2000 Census, the largest ancestry groups in Colorado are [[German American|German]] (22%) including of Swiss and [[Austrians|Austrian]] nationalities, [[Mexican-American|Mexican]] (18%), Irish (12%), and English (12%). Persons reporting [[German American|German ancestry]] are especially numerous in the Front Range, the Rockies (west-central counties) and Eastern parts/High Plains.

Colorado has a high proportion of [[Hispanic]], mostly [[Mexican-American]], citizens in Metropolitan Denver, Colorado Springs, as well as the smaller cities of Greeley and Pueblo, and elsewhere. Colorado is well known for its strong Latino culture and presence. Southern, Southwestern, and Southeastern Colorado has a large number of [[Hispanos]], the descendants of the early Mexican settlers of colonial Spanish origin. In 1940, the Census Bureau reported Colorado's population as 8.2% Hispanic and 90.3% non-Hispanic white.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Historical Census Statistics on Population Totals By Race, 1790 to 1990, and By Hispanic Origin, 1970 to 1990, For The United States, Regions, Divisions, and States|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|url=http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0056/twps0056.html|accessdate=January 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hispanic population of Colorado has continued to grow quickly over the past decades. By 2012, Hispanics made up 21% of Colorado's population, and [[Non-Hispanic White]]s made up 69%.&lt;ref name=&quot;quickfacts.census.gov&quot;/&gt;

The [[2000 United States Census]] found that 10.5% of people aged five and over in Colorado speak only Spanish at home, with the 2009 estimate being roughly 14%. Colorado also has a large immigration presence all throughout the state, which has led to Colorado cities being referred to as &quot;Sanctuary Cities&quot; for illegal immigrants as well. Colorado has the 4th highest percentage of undocumented people in the U.S., only behind Nevada, Arizona, California, and tied with Texas. An estimated 5.5â€“6.0% of the state's population is composed of illegal immigrants. Also, over 20% of the state's prisoners are undocumented inmates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Fred Elbel, CAIR |url=http://www.cairco.org/issues/issues_crime_colorado.html |title=Crime and illegal aliens in Colorado â€“ CAIR â€“ Colorado Alliance for Immigration Reform |publisher=Cairco.org |date=May 19, 2005 |accessdate=June 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mla.org/map_data_results&amp;state_id=8&amp;mode=state_tops&amp;order=r |title=Language Map Data Center |publisher=Mla.org |date=July 17, 2007 |accessdate=July 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colorado, like New Mexico, is very rich in archaic Spanish idioms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elcastellano.org/palabra.php?id=946 |title=talking about Colorado in &quot;nada&quot; |publisher=Elcastellano.org |date=June 30, 2007 |accessdate=July 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colorado also has some large African-American communities located in Denver, in the neighborhoods of Montbello, Five Points, Whittier, and many other East Denver areas. A relatively large population of African Americans are also found in Colorado Springs on the east and southeast side of the city. The state has sizable numbers of Asian-Americans of [[Mongolian American|Mongolian]], [[Chinese American|Chinese]], [[Filipino American|Filipino]], [[Koreans|Korean]], [[Southeast Asian]] and [[Japanese American|Japanese]] descent. The highest population of Asian Americans can be found on the south and southeast side of Denver, as well as some on Denver's southwest side. The Denver metropolitan area is considered more liberal and diverse than much of the state when it comes to political issues and environmental concerns.

There were a total of 70,331 births in Colorado in 2006. (Birth Rate of 14.6). In 2007, non-Hispanic whites were involved in 59.1% of all the births.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr57/nvsr57_12.pdf |title=National Vital Statistics Reports, Volume 57, Number 12, (March 18, 2009) |format=PDF |accessdate=July 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some 14.06% of those births involved a non-Hispanic white person and someone of a different race, most often with a couple including one Hispanic.

Per the 2000 census, the Hispanic population is estimated to be 918,899 or approximately 20% of the state total population. Colorado has the 5th largest population of [[Mexican-Americans]] behind California, Texas, Arizona, and Illinois. In percentages, Colorado has the 6th highest percentage of Mexican-Americans behind New Mexico, California, Texas, Arizona, and Nevada.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statemaster.com/state/CO-colorado/peo-people&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;], Statemaster Colorado&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cannabis ===

Colorado is one of two states to [[Legality of cannabis by US state|legalize]] both the [[Medical cannabis in the United States#Colorado|medicinal]] (2000) and [[Colorado Amendment 64|recreational]] (2014) use of marijuana.

Amendment 64 also requires the Colorado state legislature to enact regulations for industrial hemp making Colorado the only source of hemp and hemp products within the United States.

==== Medicinal use ====
On November 7, 2000, 54% of Colorado voters passed Amendment 20, which amends the Colorado State constitution to allow the [[medical use of cannabis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;norml-co&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://norml.com/index.cfm?Group_ID=3391 |title=Active State Medical Marijuana Programs - NORML

==== Recreational use ====
On November 6, 2012, voters amended the state constitution to protect [[Colorado Amendment 64|&quot;personal use&quot; of marijuana for adults]], establishing a framework to regulate [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] in a manner similar to [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]].

Early industry was based on the extraction and processing of minerals and agricultural products. Current agricultural products are cattle, wheat, [[dairy product]]s, [[maize|corn]], and [[hay]].

The [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] is also a major economic force in the state with many important federal facilities including [[NORAD]] (North American Aerospace Defense Command), [[United States Air Force Academy]], Schriever Air Force Base located approximately 10 miles (16 kilometers) east of [[Peterson Air Force Base]], and Fort Carson, both located in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]] within El Paso County; [[NOAA]], the National Renewable Energy Laboratory ([[NREL]]) in Golden, and the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] in [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]]; [[U.S. Geological Survey]] and other government agencies at the Denver Federal Center near [[Lakewood, Colorado|Lakewood]]; the [[Denver Mint]], [[Buckley Air Force Base]], and [[United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit|Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals]] in Denver; and a federal [[ADX Florence|Supermax Prison]] and other federal prisons near [[CaĂ±on City, Colorado|CaĂ±on City]].

In the second half of the 20th century, the industrial and service sectors have expanded greatly. The state's economy is diversified and is notable for its concentration of scientific research and high-technology industries. Other industries include [[food processing]], transportation equipment, [[Mechanical engineering|machinery]], [[chemical engineering|chemical products]], the extraction of metals such as gold (see [[Gold mining in Colorado]]), silver, and [[molybdenum]]. Colorado now also has the largest annual production of beer of any state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2007/nov/24/reuteman-colorado-rides-on-fat-tire-to-beer/ |title=Colorado rides on Fat Tire to beer heights |publisher=Rockymountainnews.com |date=November 24, 2007 |accessdate=June 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Denver is an important financial center.

A number of nationally known brand names have originated in Colorado factories and laboratories. From [[Denver#Economy|Denver]] came the forerunner of telecommunications giant [[Qwest Corporation|Qwest]] in 1879, [[Samsonite]] luggage in 1910, [[Gates Corporation|Gates]] belts and hoses in 1911, and [[Russell Stover Candies]] in 1923. Kuner canned vegetables began in [[Brighton, Colorado|Brighton]] in 1864. From [[Golden, Colorado|Golden]] came [[Coors Brewing Company|Coors]] beer in 1873, [[CoorsTek]] industrial ceramics in 1920, and [[Jolly Rancher]] candy in 1949. [[Colorado Fuel and Iron|CF&amp;I]] railroad rails, wire, nails and pipe debuted in [[Pueblo, Colorado|Pueblo]] in 1892. [[Imperial Sugar|Holly Sugar]] was first milled from beets in [[Holly, Colorado|Holly]] in 1905, and later moved its headquarters to Colorado Springs. The present-day [[Swift &amp; Company|Swift]] packed meat of [[Greeley, Colorado|Greeley]] evolved from Monfort of Colorado, Inc., established in 1930. [[Estes Industries|Estes]] model rockets were launched in [[Penrose, Colorado|Penrose]] in 1958. [[Fort Collins, Colorado|Fort Collins]] has been the home of [[Woodward Governor Company]]'s motor controllers (governors) since 1870, and [[Oral irrigator|Waterpik]] dental water jets and showerheads since 1962. [[Celestial Seasonings]] herbal teas have been made in [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]] since 1969. [[Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory]] made its first candy in [[Durango, Colorado|Durango]] in 1981.

Colorado has a flat 4.63% [[income tax]], regardless of income level. Unlike most states, which calculate taxes based on federal ''adjusted gross income'', Colorado taxes are based on ''taxable income'' â€“ income after federal exemptions and federal itemized (or standard) deductions.&lt;ref&gt;Colorado individual income tax return (2005) [http://www.revenue.state.co.us/PDF/05104f.pdf Revenue.state.co.us].

Retrieved September 26, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Colorado's state [[sales tax]] is 2.9% on retail sales. When state revenues exceed state constitutional limits, full-year Colorado residents can claim a sales tax refund on their individual state income tax return. Many counties and cities charge their own rates in addition to the base state rate. There are also certain county and special district taxes that may apply.

Real estate and personal business property are taxable in Colorado. The state's senior property tax exemption was temporarily suspended by the Colorado Legislature in 2003. The tax break is scheduled to return for assessment year 2006, payable in 2007.

As of August 2014, the state's unemployment rate is 5.3%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bls.gov/lau/ Bls.gov]; Local Area Unemployment Statistics&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philanthropy===
Major philanthropic organizations based in Colorado, include the [[Daniels Fund]], the Anschutz Family Foundation, the [[Gates Family Foundation]], the El Pomar Foundation and the [[Boettcher Foundation]] grant each year from approximately $7 billion&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cof.org/files/Documents/Government/StateGiving/CO.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; of assets.

===Natural resources===
[[File:Grand Junction Trip 92007 131.JPG|thumb|An [[oil well]] in western Colorado]]
Colorado has significant [[hydrocarbon]] resources. According to the [[Energy Information Administration]], Colorado hosts seven of the Nationâ€™s 100 largest natural gas fields and two of its 100 largest [[oil field]]s. Conventional and unconventional natural gas output from several Colorado basins typically account for more than 5 percent of annual U.S. natural gas production. Coloradoâ€™s [[oil shale]] deposits hold an estimated {{convert|1|Toilbbl|km3}} of oil â€“ nearly as much oil as the entire worldâ€™s proven oil reserves; the economic viability of the oil shale, however, has not been demonstrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Substantial deposits of [[bituminous coal|bituminous]], [[sub-bituminous coal|subbituminous]], and [[lignite]] coal are found in the state.

Colorado's high Rocky Mountain ridges and eastern plains offer [[wind power]] potential, and geologic activity in the mountain areas provides potential for [[geothermal electricity|geothermal power]] development. Much of the state is sunny and could produce [[solar power in Colorado|solar power]]. Major rivers flowing from the Rocky Mountains offer [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric power]] resources. Corn grown in the flat eastern part of the state offers potential resources for [[ethanol]] production.

==Transportation==
{{main|Transportation in Colorado}}
[[File:Colorado.JPG|thumb|left|A Colorado state welcome sign]]
Colorado's transportation system is extensive and has been the genesis of world-class innovations in highway and railway construction as well as airport design, infrastructure development, and operational innovation.

Colorado's primary mode of transportation (in terms of passengers) is its highway system. [[Interstate 25 in Colorado|Interstate&amp;nbsp;25]] (I-25) is the primary northâ€“south highway in the state, connecting Pueblo, Colorado Springs, Denver, and Fort Collins, and extending north to Wyoming and south to New Mexico. [[Interstate 70 in Colorado|I-70]] is the primary eastâ€“west corridor. It connects Grand Junction and the mountain communities with Denver, and enters Utah and Kansas. The state is home to a network of US and Colorado highways that provide access to all principal areas of the state. Smaller communities are only connected to this network via county roads.

[[File:DIA.jpg|thumb|right|The main terminal of Denver International Airport evokes the peaks of the [[Front Range]].]]
[[Denver International Airport]] (DIA) is the fourth busiest domestic U.S. airport and thirteenth [[World's busiest airports by passenger traffic|busiest world airport]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airports.org/cda/aci_common/display/main/aci_content07_c.jsp?zn=aci&amp;cp=1-5-212-218-222_666_2__ Year to Date Passenger Traffic]&lt;/ref&gt; DIA handles by far the largest volume of commercial air traffic in Colorado, and is the busiest U.S. hub airport between Chicago and the Pacific coast, making Denver the most important airport for connecting passenger traffic in the western U.S.
Denver International Airport is the primary hub for low-cost carrier [[Frontier Airlines]], with routes throughout North America. It is also the fourth-largest hub of the world's largest airline, [[United Airlines]]. DIA is a [[focus city]] for [[Southwest Airlines]], which since commencing service to Denver in January 2006, has added over 50 destinations, making Denver its fastest-growing market. Denver International Airport is the only airport in the United States to have implemented an [[ISO 14001]]-certified environmental management system covering the entire airport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=2009 Annual Report|url=http://business.flydenver.com/community/enviro/documents/annualReport2009.pdf|work=City &amp; County of Denver Department of Aviation|accessdate=July 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Extensive public transportation bus services are offered both intra-city and inter-cityâ€”including the Denver metro area's extensive RTD services. The [[Regional Transportation District]] (RTD) operates the popular [[RTD Bus &amp; Light Rail]] transit system in the [[Denver Metropolitan Area]]. As of January 2013 the RTD rail system had 170 light rail vehicles, serving {{convert|47|mi|km}} of track.

[[File:California Zephyr--Eastbound meets Westbound in Glenwood Canyon.jpg|thumb|left|The westbound and eastbound ''[[California Zephyr]]s'' meet in the [[Glenwood Canyon]].]]
[[Amtrak]] operates two rail passenger lines through Colorado, including the Glenwood Canyon route of the famed [[California Zephyr]], one of America's legendary passenger trains.
Colorado's contribution to world railroad history was forged principally by the [[Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad]] which began in 1870 and wrote the book on mountain railroading. In 1988 the &quot;Rio Grande&quot; acquired, but was merged into, the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] by their joint owner [[Philip Anschutz]]. On September 11, 1996, Anschutz sold the combined company to the [[Union Pacific Railroad]], creating the largest railroad network in the United States. The Anschutz sale was partly in response to the earlier merger of Burlington Northern and Santa Fe which formed the large Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway (BNSF), Union Pacific's principal competitor in western U.S. railroading. Both Union Pacific and BNSF have extensive freight operations in Colorado.

Colorado's freight railroad network consists of 2,688 miles of Class I trackage. It is integral to the U.S. economy, being a critical artery for the movement of energy, agriculture, mining, and industrial commodities as well as general freight and manufactured products between the East and Midwest and the Pacific coast states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aar.org/keyissues/Pages/Railroads-And-States.aspx |title=Railroads and States |publisher=Aar.org |accessdate=July 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===State government===
{{See also|Political party strength in Colorado}}
Like the federal government and all other U.S. states, Colorado's [[Constitution of the State of Colorado|state constitution]] provides for three branches of government: the legislative, the executive, and the judicial branches.

The [[Governor of Colorado]] heads the state's executive branch. The current governor is [[John Hickenlooper]], a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]]. Colorado's other statewide elected executive officers are the [[Lieutenant Governor of Colorado]] (elected on a [[Ticket (election)|ticket]] with the Governor), [[Secretary of State of Colorado]], [[Colorado State Treasurer]], and [[Attorney General of Colorado]], all of whom serve four-year terms.

The seven-member [[Colorado Supreme Court]] is the highest judicial court in the state.
The state legislative body is the [[Colorado General Assembly]], which is made up of two houses, the [[Colorado House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and the [[Colorado Senate|Senate]]. The House has 65 members and the Senate has 35. {{as of|2013}}, the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] holds an 18 to 17 majority in the Senate and a 37 to 28 majority in the House.

===Special districts===
The state of Colorado has more than 3,000 districts with taxing authority. These districts may provide schools, law enforcement, fire protection, water, sewage, drainage, irrigation, transportation, recreation, infrastructure, cultural facilities, business support, redevelopment, or other services.

Some of these districts have authority to levy sales tax and well as property tax and use fees. This has led to a hodgepodge of sales tax and property tax rates in Colorado. There are some street intersections in Colorado with a different sales tax rate on each corner, sometimes substantially different.

Some of the more notable Colorado districts are:
* The [[Regional Transportation District]] (RTD), which affects the counties of Denver, Boulder, Jefferson, and portions of Adams, Arapahoe, Broomfield, and Douglas Counties
* The [[Scientific and Cultural Facilities District]] (SCFD), a special regional tax district with physical boundaries contiguous with county boundaries of Adams, Arapahoe, Boulder, Broomfield, Denver, Douglas, and Jefferson Counties
** It is a 0.1% retail sales and use tax (one penny on every $10).
** According to the Colorado statute, the SCFD distributes the money to local organizations on an annual basis. These organizations must provide for the enlightenment and entertainment of the public through the production, presentation, exhibition, advancement or preservation of art, music, theater, dance, zoology, botany, natural history or cultural history.
** As directed by statute, SCFD recipient organizations are currently divided into three &quot;tiers&quot; among which receipts are allocated by percentage.
*** Tier I includes regional organizations: the Denver Art Museum, the Denver Botanic Gardens, the Denver Museum of Nature and Science, the Denver Zoo, and the Denver Center for the Performing Arts. It receives 65.5%.
*** Tier II currently includes 26 regional organizations. Tier II receives 21%.
*** Tier III has over 280 local organizations such as small theaters, orchestras, art centers, and natural history, cultural history, and community groups. Tier III organizations apply for funding to the county cultural councils via a grant process. This tier receives 13.5%.
** An 11-member board of directors oversees the distributions in accordance with the Colorado Revised Statutes. Seven board members are appointed by county commissioners (in Denver, the Denver City Council) and four members are appointed by the Governor of Colorado.
* The Football Stadium District (FD or FTBL), approved by the voters to pay for and help build the [[Denver Broncos]]' stadium [[Sports Authority Field at Mile High]]
* Local Improvement Districts (LID) within designated areas of southeast Jefferson and Boulder counties
* Regional Transportation Authority (RTA) taxes at varying rates in Basalt, Carbondale, Glenwood Springs, Gunnison County

Colorado is considered a [[swing state]] in both state and federal elections. Coloradans have elected 17 [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] and 12 [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] to the governorship in the last 100 years. In presidential politics, Colorado was considered a reliably Republican state during the post-World War II era, only voting for the Democratic candidate in 1964 and 1992. However, it became a competitive swing state by the turn of the century, and voted consecutively for Democrat Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012.

Colorado politics has the contrast of conservative cities such as Colorado Springs and liberal cities such as Boulder and Denver. Democrats are strongest in [[Denver Metropolitan Area|metropolitan Denver]], the college towns of [[Fort Collins, Colorado|Fort Collins]] and [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]], southern Colorado (including Pueblo), and a few western ski resort counties. The Republicans are strongest in the Eastern Plains, Colorado Springs, Greeley, and far Western Colorado near Grand Junction.

The state of Colorado is represented by its two [[United States Senator]]s:
* [[Classes of United States Senators|United States Senate Class 2]] â€“ [[Mark Emery Udall]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]) 2009â€“
* [[Classes of United States Senators|United States Senate Class 3]] â€“ [[Michael Farrand Bennet]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]])&lt;ref name=Bennet&gt;[[Governor of Colorado|Governor]] [[Bill Ritter]] appointed [[Michael Bennet]] to serve the remaining two years of [[United States Senator]] [[Ken Salazar]] term of office which was left vacant on January 20, 2009, when new United States President [[Barack Obama]] appointed the Colorado Senator to serve in his [[United States Cabinet|Cabinet]] as [[United States Secretary of the Interior]].&lt;/ref&gt; 2009â€“
Colorado is represented by seven [[United States House of Representatives|Representatives]] to the [[United States House of Representatives]]:
* [[Colorado's 1st congressional district]] â€“ [[Diana Louise DeGette]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]) 1997â€“
* [[Colorado's 2nd congressional district]] â€“ [[Jared Schutz Polis]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]) 2009â€“

===Significant bills passed in Colorado===
On the November 8, 1932 ballot, Colorado approved the [[Repeal of Prohibition|repeal of alcohol prohibition]] more than a year before the federal government passed the [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution]].

In 2012, voters amended the state constitution to protect [[Colorado Amendment 64|&quot;personal use&quot; of marijuana for adults]], establishing a framework to regulate [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] in a manner similar to [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]]. The first recreational marijuana shops in Colorado, and by extension the United States, opened their doors on January 1, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Healy|first=Jack|title=Colorado Stores Throw Open Their Doors to Pot Buyers|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/02/us/colorado-stores-throw-open-their-doors-to-pot-buyers.html?_r=0|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=January 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Augustine of Canterbury''' (first third of the 6th century&amp;nbsp;â€“ probably 26 May 604) was a [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] [[monk]] who became the first [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] in the year 597. He is considered the &quot;Apostle to the English&quot; and a founder of the English Church.&lt;ref name=DictSaint&gt;Delaney ''Dictionary of Saints'' pp. 67â€“68&lt;/ref&gt;

Augustine was the [[prior]] of a monastery in [[Rome]] when Pope [[Pope Gregory I|Gregory the Great]] chose him in 595 to lead a mission, usually known as the [[Gregorian mission]], to Britain to [[Christianization|Christianize]] King [[Ă†thelberht of Kent|Ă†thelberht]] and his [[Kingdom of Kent]] from their native [[Anglo-Saxon paganism]]. Kent was probably chosen because Ă†thelberht had married a Christian princess, [[Bertha of Kent|Bertha]], daughter of [[Charibert I]] the [[List of Frankish kings|King of Paris]], who was expected to exert some influence over her husband. Before reaching Kent the missionaries had considered turning back but Gregory urged them on, and in 597 Augustine landed on the [[Isle of Thanet]] and proceeded to Ă†thelberht's main town of [[Canterbury]].

King Ă†thelberht converted to Christianity and allowed the missionaries to preach freely, giving them land to found a monastery outside the city walls. Augustine was consecrated as a [[bishop]] and converted many of the king's subjects, including thousands during a mass baptism on [[Christmas|Christmas Day]] in 597. Pope Gregory sent more missionaries in 601, along with encouraging letters and gifts for the churches, although attempts to persuade the native [[Celts|Celtic]] bishops to submit to Augustine's authority failed. Roman bishops were established at London and Rochester in 604, and a school was founded to train [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] priests and missionaries. Augustine also arranged the consecration of his successor, [[Laurence of Canterbury]]. The archbishop probably died in 604 and was soon revered as a [[saint]].

== Background to the mission ==
After the withdrawal of the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[Roman legion|legions]] from their province of [[Britannia]] in 410, the inhabitants were left to defend themselves against the attacks of the [[Saxons]]. Before the Roman withdrawal Britannia had been converted to Christianity and produced the [[ascetic]] [[Pelagius]].&lt;ref name=Hindley3/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mayr78/&gt; Britain sent three bishops to the [[Synod of Arles#Council of Arles in 314|Council of Arles]] in 314, and a [[Gaulish]] bishop went to the island in 396 to help settle disciplinary matters.&lt;ref name=Frend80&gt;Frend &quot;Roman Britain&quot; ''Cross Goes North'' pp. 80â€“81&lt;/ref&gt; Material remains testify to a growing presence of Christians, at least until around 360.&lt;ref name=Frend82&gt;Frend &quot;Roman Britain&quot; ''Cross Goes North'' pp. 82â€“86&lt;/ref&gt; After the Roman legions departed, pagan tribes settled the southern parts of the island while western Britain, beyond the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, remained Christian. This native [[Celtic Christianity|British Church]] developed in isolation from Rome under the influence of missionaries from Ireland&lt;ref name=Hindley3&gt;Hindley ''Brief History of the Anglo-Saxons'' pp. 3â€“9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mayr78/&gt; and was centred on monasteries instead of bishoprics. Other distinguishing characteristics were its calculation of the date of [[Easter]] and the style of the [[tonsure]] haircut that clerics wore.&lt;ref name=Mayr78&gt;Mayr-Harting ''Coming of Christianity'' pp. 78â€“93&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Yorke115&gt;Yorke ''Conversion of Britain'' pp. 115â€“118 discusses the issue of the &quot;Celtic Church&quot; and what exactly it was.&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence for the survival of Christianity in the eastern part of Britain during this time includes the survival of the cult of [[Saint Alban]] and the occurrence in place names of ''eccles'', derived from the Latin ''ecclesia'', meaning &quot;church&quot;.&lt;ref name=Yorke121&gt;Yorke ''Conversion of Britain'' p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; There is no evidence that these native Christians tried to convert the Anglo-Saxons.&lt;ref name=ASE102&gt;Stenton ''Anglo-Saxon England'' p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Harting32&gt;Mayr-Harting ''Coming of Christianity'' pp. 32â€“33&lt;/ref&gt; The invasions destroyed most remnants of Roman civilisation in the areas held by the Saxons and related tribes, including the economic and religious structures .&lt;ref name=Kirby23&gt;Kirby ''Earliest English Kings'' p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

It was against this background that Pope Gregory I decided to send a mission, often called the Gregorian mission, to convert the Anglo-Saxons to Christianity in 595.&lt;ref name=ASE104&gt;Stenton ''Anglo-Saxon England'' pp. 104â€“105&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jones&gt;Jones &quot;Gregorian Mission&quot; ''Speculum''&lt;/ref&gt; The Kingdom of Kent was ruled by Ă†thelberht, who married a Christian princess named Bertha before 588,&lt;ref name=ASE105&gt;Stenton ''Anglo-Saxon England'' pp. 105â€“106&lt;/ref&gt; and perhaps earlier than 560.&lt;ref name=Kirby24&gt;Kirby ''Earliest English Kings'' pp. 24â€“25&lt;/ref&gt; Bertha was the daughter of Charibert I, one of the [[Merovingian]] kings of the [[Franks]]. As one of the conditions of her marriage, she brought a bishop named [[Liudhard]] with her to Kent.&lt;ref name=DNBBertha&gt;Nelson &quot;Bertha&quot; ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''&lt;/ref&gt; Together in Canterbury, they restored a church that dated to Roman times&lt;ref name=Hindley33&gt;Hindley ''Brief History of the Anglo-Saxons'' pp. 33â€“36&lt;/ref&gt;â€”possibly the current [[St Martin's Church, Canterbury|St Martin's Church]]. Ă†thelberht was a pagan at this point but allowed his wife freedom of worship. One biographer of Bertha states that under his wife's influence, Ă†thelberht asked Pope Gregory to send missionaries.&lt;ref name=DNBBertha/&gt; The historian Ian Wood feels that the initiative came from the Kentish court as well as the queen.&lt;ref name=Wood10&gt;Wood &quot;Mission of Augustine of Canterbury&quot; ''Speculum'' pp. 9â€“10&lt;/ref&gt; Other historians, however, believe that Gregory initiated the mission, although the exact reasons remain unclear. [[Bede]], an 8th-century monk who wrote a history of the English church, recorded a famous story in which Gregory saw fair-haired Saxon slaves from Britain in the Roman slave market and was inspired to try to convert their people.{{efn|Supposedly Gregory inquired about who the slaves were. He was told they were Angles from the island of Great Britain. Gregory replied that they were not Angles, but Angels.&lt;ref&gt;Bede ''History of the English Church and People'' pp. 99â€“100&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref name=Harting57&gt;Mayr-Harting ''Coming of Christianity'' pp. 57â€“59&lt;/ref&gt; More practical matters, such as the acquisition of new provinces acknowledging the primacy of the papacy, and a desire to influence the emerging power of the Kentish kingdom under Ă†thelberht, were probably involved.&lt;ref name=Hindley33/&gt; The mission may have been an outgrowth of the missionary efforts against the [[Lombards]] who, as pagans and [[Arian]] Christians, were not on good relations with the Catholic church in Rome.&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;Mayr-Harting &quot;Augustine&quot; ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from Ă†thelberht's granting of freedom of worship to his wife, the choice of Kent was probably dictated by a number of other factors. Kent was the dominant power in southeastern Britain. Since the eclipse of King [[Ceawlin of Wessex]] in 592, Ă†thelberht was the leading Anglo-Saxon ruler; Bede refers to Ă†thelberht as having [[imperium]] (overlordship) south of the [[Humber|River Humber]]. Trade between the Franks and Ă†thelberht's kingdom was well established, and the [[language barrier]] between the two regions was apparently only a minor obstacle, as the interpreters for the mission came from the Franks. Lastly, Kent's proximity to the Franks allowed support from a Christian area.&lt;ref name=Brooks7&gt;Brooks ''Early History of the Church of Canterbury'' pp. 6â€“7&lt;/ref&gt; There is some evidence, including Gregory's letters to Frankish kings in support of the mission, that some of the Franks felt that they had a claim to overlordship over some of the southern British kingdoms at this time. The presence of a Frankish bishop could also have lent credence to claims of overlordship, if Bertha's Bishop Liudhard was felt to be acting as a representative of the Frankish church and not merely as a spiritual advisor to the queen. Frankish influence was not merely political; archaeological remains attest to a cultural influence as well.&lt;ref name=Kirby27&gt;Kirby ''Earliest English Kings'' p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

In 595, Gregory chose Augustine, who was the prior of the [[San Gregorio Magno al Celio|Abbey of St Andrew's]] in Rome, to head the mission to Kent.&lt;ref name=ASE104/&gt; The pope selected monks to accompany Augustine and sought support from the Frankish royalty and clergy in a series of letters, of which some copies survive in Rome. He wrote to King [[Theuderic II]] of [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]] and to King [[Theudebert II]] of [[Austrasia]], as well as their grandmother [[Brunhilda of Austrasia|Brunhild]], seeking aid for the mission. Gregory thanked King [[Chlothar II]] of [[Neustria]] for aiding Augustine. Besides hospitality, the Frankish bishops and kings provided interpreters and Frankish priests to accompany the mission.&lt;ref name=Brooks4&gt;Brooks ''Early History of the Church of Canterbury'' pp. 4â€“5&lt;/ref&gt; By soliciting help from the Frankish kings and bishops, Gregory helped to assure a friendly reception for Augustine in Kent, as Ă†thelbert was unlikely to mistreat a mission which visibly had the support of his wife's relatives and people.&lt;ref name=Brooks6&gt;Brooks ''Early History of the Church of Canterbury'' p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the Franks appreciated the chance to participate in mission that would extend their influence in Kent. Chlothar, in particular, needed a friendly realm across the Channel to help guard his kingdom's flanks against his fellow Frankish kings.&lt;ref name=Wood9&gt;Wood &quot;Mission of Augustine of Canterbury&quot; ''Speculum'' p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Sources make no mention of why Pope Gregory chose a monk to head the mission. Pope Gregory once wrote to Ă†thelberht complimenting Augustine's knowledge of the [[Bible]], so Augustine was evidently well educated. Other qualifications included administrative ability, for Gregory was the abbot of St Andrews as well as being pope, which left the day-to-day running of the abbey to Augustine, the prior.&lt;ref name=Fletcher116&gt;Fletcher ''Barbarian Conversion'' pp. 116â€“117&lt;/ref&gt;

Augustine was accompanied by Laurence of Canterbury, his eventual successor to the [[archbishop]]ric, and a group of about 40 companions, some of whom were monks.&lt;ref name=ASE105/&gt; Soon after leaving Rome, the missionaries halted, daunted by the nature of the task before them. They sent Augustine back to Rome to request papal permission to return. Gregory refused and sent Augustine back with letters encouraging the missionaries to persevere.&lt;ref name=Blair116&gt;Blair ''Introduction to Anglo-Saxon England'' pp. 116â€“117&lt;/ref&gt; In 597, Augustine and his companions landed in Kent.&lt;ref name=ASE105/&gt; They achieved some initial success soon after their arrival:&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fletcher116&quot; /&gt; Ă†thelberht permitted the missionaries to settle and preach in his capital of Canterbury where they used the church of St Martin's for services.&lt;ref name=Brooks8/&gt; Neither Bede nor Gregory mentions the date of Ă†thelberht's conversion,&lt;ref name=Woods11&gt;Wood &quot;Mission of Augustine of Canterbury&quot; ''Speculum'' p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; but it probably took place in 597.&lt;ref name=Brooks8/&gt;{{efn|However, Bede's chronology may be a bit off, as he gives the king's death as occurring in February 616, and says the king died 21 years after his conversion, which would date the conversion to 595. This would be before Augustine's mission, and directly contradicts Bede's statement that the king's conversion was due to Augustine's mission.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirby24&quot; /&gt; However, as Gregory in his letter of 601 to the king and queen strongly implies that the queen was unable to effect the conversion of her husband, the problem of the dating is likely a chronological error on Bede's part.&lt;ref name=Kirby28/&gt;}} In the [[Early Middle Ages|early medieval]] period, large-scale conversions required the ruler's conversion first, and Augustine is recorded as making large numbers of converts within a year of his arrival in Kent.&lt;ref name=Brooks8/&gt; Also, by 601, Gregory was writing to both Ă†thelberht and Bertha, calling the king his son and referring to his baptism.{{efn|The letter, as translated in Brooks' ''Early History of the Church of Canterbury'', p. 8, says &quot;preserve the grace he had received&quot;. ''Grace'' in this context meant the grace of baptism.}} A [[Late Middle Ages|late medieval]] tradition, recorded by the 15th-century chronicler [[Thomas Elmham]], gives the date of the king's conversion as [[Pentecost|Whit Sunday]], or 2 June 597; there is no reason to doubt this date, although there is no other evidence for it.&lt;ref name=Brooks8&gt;Brooks ''Early History of the Church of Canterbury'' pp. 8â€“9&lt;/ref&gt; Against a date in 597 is a letter of Gregory's to Patriarch [[Eulogius of Alexandria]] in June 598, which mentions the number of converts made by Augustine, but does not mention any baptism of the king. However, it is clear that by 601 the king had been converted.&lt;ref name=Kirby28&gt;Kirby ''Earliest English Kings'' p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; His baptism likely took place at Canterbury.&lt;ref name=Convert56&gt;Higham ''Convert Kings'' p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;

Augustine established his [[episcopal see]] at Canterbury.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; It is not clear when and where Augustine was consecrated as a bishop. Bede, writing about a century later, states that Augustine was consecrated by the Frankish Archbishop Ă†therius of [[Arles]] after the conversion of Ă†thelberht. Contemporary letters from Pope Gregory, however, refer to Augustine as a bishop before he arrived in England. A letter of Gregory's from September 597 calls Augustine a bishop, and one dated ten months later says Augustine had been consecrated on Gregory's command by bishops of the German lands.&lt;ref name=Brooks5&gt;Brooks ''Early History of the Church of Canterbury'' p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; The historian R. A. Markus discusses the various theories of when and where Augustine was consecrated, and suggests he was consecrated before arriving in England, but argues the evidence does not permit deciding exactly where this took place.&lt;ref name=Markus24&gt;Markus &quot;Chronology of the Gregorian Mission&quot; ''Journal of Ecclesiastical History'' pp. 24â€“29&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after his arrival, Augustine founded the [[monastery]] of Saints [[Saint Peter|Peter]] and [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]], which later became [[St Augustine's Abbey]],&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; on land donated by the king.&lt;ref name=Blair61&gt;Blair ''Church in Anglo-Saxon Society'' pp. 61â€“62&lt;/ref&gt; This foundation has often been claimed as the first Benedictine abbey outside Italy, and that by founding it, Augustine introduced the [[Rule of St. Benedict]] into England, but there is no evidence the abbey followed the Benedictine Rule at the time of its foundation.&lt;ref name=Monasticism55&gt;Lawrence ''Medieval Monasticism'' p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter Gregory wrote to the [[patriarch of Alexandria]] in 598, he claimed that more than 10,000 Christians had been baptised; the number may be exaggerated but there is no reason to doubt that a mass conversion took place.&lt;ref name=ASE105/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fletcher116/&gt; However, there were probably some Christians already in Kent before Augustine arrived, remnants of the Christians who lived in Britain in the later Roman Empire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harting32&quot; /&gt; Little literary traces remain of them, however.&lt;ref name=Frend79&gt;Frend &quot;Roman Britain&quot; ''Cross Goes North'' p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; One other effect of the king's conversion by Augustine's mission was that the Frankish influence on the southern kingdoms of Britain was decreased.&lt;ref name=Kirby29&gt;Kirby ''Earliest English Kings'' p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

After these conversions, Augustine sent Laurence back to Rome with a report of his success, along with questions about the mission.&lt;ref name=ASE106&gt;Stenton ''Anglo-Saxon England'' p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; Bede records the letter and Gregory's replies in chapter 27 of his ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum]]''; this section of the ''History'' is usually known as the ''[[Libellus responsionum]]''.&lt;ref name=Laurentius&gt;Lapidge &quot;Laurentius&quot; ''Blackwell Enclyclopaedia of Anglo-Saxon England''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bede71/&gt; Augustine asked for Gregory's advice on a number of issues, including how to organise the church, the punishment for church robbers, guidance on who was allowed to marry whom, and the consecration of bishops. Other topics were relations between the churches of Britain and Gaul, childbirth and baptism, and when it was lawful for people to receive communion and for a priest to celebrate mass.&lt;ref name=Bede71&gt;Bede ''History of the English Church and People'' pp. 71â€“83&lt;/ref&gt;

Further missionaries were sent from Rome in 601. They brought a [[pallium]] for Augustine and a present of sacred vessels, [[vestment]]s, [[relic]]s, and books.{{efn|What happened to these items in later years is unknown. [[Thomas Elmham]], a 15th-century chronicler at Canterbury, gave a number of theories of how most of these objects were lost, including being hidden and never recovered during the [[Norse activity in the British Isles|Danish attacks]] in the 9th and 10th centuries, hidden and lost after the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman Conquest of England]] in 1066, or used for the ransom of King [[Richard I of England]] in the 1190s.&lt;ref name=Dodwell10&gt;Dodwell ''Anglo-Saxon Art'' p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; The surviving [[St Augustine Gospels]], ([[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]] manuscript (MS) 286) which is a 6th-century Italian-illuminated [[Gospel Book]], may be one of the works sent to Augustine. Traditionally, it has been associated with the [[Gregorian mission]].&lt;ref name=Dodwell96&gt;Dodwell ''Anglo-Saxon Art'' pp. 96 and 276 footnote 66&lt;/ref&gt; Another possible survivor is a copy of the ''[[Rule of St Benedict]]'', now MS Oxford [[Bodleian Library|Bodleian]] Hatton 48.&lt;ref name=Colgrave27&gt;Colgrave &quot;Introduction&quot; ''Earliest Life of Gregory the Great'' pp. 27â€“28&lt;/ref&gt; Yet another possible survival is a Gospel, in an Italian hand, and closely related to the Augustine Gospels, now MS Oxford Bodelian Auctarium D.2.14, which shows evidence of being held in Anglo-Saxon hands during the right time frame. Lastly, a fragment of a work by Gregory the Great, now held by the [[British Library]] as part of MS [[Cotton library|Cotton]] Titus C may have arrived with the missionaries.&lt;ref name=Library24&gt;Lapidge ''Anglo-Saxon Library'' pp. 24â€“25&lt;/ref&gt;}} The pallium was the symbol of [[Metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] status, and signified that Augustine was now an archbishop unambiguously associated with the Holy See. Along with the pallium, a letter from Gregory directed the new archbishop to ordain 12 [[suffragan bishop]]s as soon as possible and to send a bishop to [[York]]. Gregory's plan was that there would be two metropolitans, one at York and one at [[London]], with 12 suffragan bishops under each archbishop. As part of this plan, Augustine was expected to transfer his archiepiscopal see to London from Canterbury. The move from Canterbury to London never happened; no contemporary sources give the reason,&lt;ref name=Brooks9&gt;Brooks ''Early History of the Church of Canterbury'' pp. 9â€“11&lt;/ref&gt; but it was probably because London was not part of Ă†thelberht's domains. Instead, London was part of the [[kingdom of Essex]], ruled by Ă†thelberht's nephew [[Saebert of Essex]], who converted to Christianity in 604.&lt;ref name=Hindley33/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fletcher453&gt;Fletcher ''Barbarian Conversion'' p. 453&lt;/ref&gt; The historian S. Brechter has suggested that the metropolitan see was indeed moved to London, and that it was only with the abandonment of London as a see after the death of Ă†thelberht that Canterbury became the archiepiscopal see. This theory contradicts Bede's version of events, however.&lt;ref name=Brooks11&gt;Brooks ''Early History of the Church of Canterbury'' pp. 11â€“14&lt;/ref&gt;

In 604, Augustine founded two more bishoprics in Britain. Two men who had come to Britain with him in 601 were consecrated, [[Mellitus]] as [[Bishop of London]] and [[Justus]] as [[Bishop of Rochester]].&lt;ref name=Hindley33/&gt;&lt;ref name=BEASE267&gt;Hayward &quot;St Justus&quot; ''Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Anglo-Saxon England'' pp. 267â€“268&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BEASE305&gt;Lapidge &quot;St Mellitus&quot; ''Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Anglo-Saxon England'' pp. 305â€“306&lt;/ref&gt; Bede relates that Augustine, with the help of the king, &quot;recovered&quot; a church built by Roman Christians in Canterbury.&lt;ref name=Brooks50/&gt;{{efn|The actual Latin is from Chapter 33, Book 1 of Bede, and an online version is [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/bede/bede1.shtml#33 here]. The sentence in question is &quot;AT Augustinus, ubi in regia ciuitate sedem episcopalem, ut praediximus, accepit, recuperauit in ea, regio fultus adminiculo, ecclesiam, quam inibi antiquo Romanorum fidelium opere factam fuisse didicerat, et eam in nomine sancti Saluatoris Dei et Domini nostri Iesu Christi sacrauit, atque ibidem sibi habitationem statuit et cunctis successoribus suis.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/bede/bede1.shtml#33|title= Historiam Ecclesiasticam Gentis Anglorum: Liber Primus |accessdate=1 April 2008|work= The Latin Library |publisher=Ad Fontes Academy | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080317064020/http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/bede/bede1.shtml| archivedate= 17 March 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Latin word ''recuperauit'' could be translated either &quot;repaired&quot; or &quot;recovered&quot;. Sherley-Price translates the sentence as &quot;Having been granted his episcopal see in the royal capital, as already recorded, Augustine proceeded with the king's help to repair a church he was informed had been built long ago by Roman Christians.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bede ''History of the English Church and People'' p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;}} It is not clear if Bede meant that Augustine rebuilt the church or that Augustine merely reconsecrated a building that had been used for pagan worship. Archaeological evidence seems to support the latter interpretation; in 1973 the remains of an aisled building dating from the [[Romano-British]] period were uncovered just south of the present [[Canterbury Cathedral]].&lt;ref name=Brooks50&gt;Brooks ''Early History of the Church of Canterbury'' p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; The historian Ian Wood argues that the existence of the ''Libellus'' points to more contact between Augustine and the native Christians because the topics covered in the work are not restricted to conversion from paganism, but also dealt with relations between differing styles of Christianity.&lt;ref name=Wood170&gt;Wood &quot;Augustine and Aidan&quot; ''L'Ă‰glise et la Mission'' p. 170&lt;/ref&gt;

Augustine failed to extend his authority to the Christians in [[Wales]] and [[Dumnonia]] to the west. Gregory had decreed that these Christians should submit to Augustine and that their bishops should obey him,&lt;ref name=Harting70&gt;Mayr-Harting ''Coming of Christianity'' pp. 70â€“72&lt;/ref&gt; apparently believing that more of the Roman governmental and ecclesiastical organisation survived in Britain than was actually the case.&lt;ref name=Conversion118&gt;Yorke ''Conversion of Britain'' p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; According to the narrative of Bede, the Britons in these regions viewed Augustine with uncertainty, and their suspicion was compounded by a diplomatic misjudgement on Augustine's part.&lt;ref name=ASE110&gt;Stenton ''Anglo-Saxon England'' pp. 110â€“111&lt;/ref&gt; In 603, Augustine and Ă†thelberht summoned the British bishops to a meeting south of the Severn. These guests retired early to confer with their people,&lt;ref name=Hindley8/&gt; who, according to Bede, advised them to judge Augustine based upon the respect he displayed at their next meeting. When Augustine failed to rise from his seat on the entrance of the British bishops,&lt;ref name=Bede100&gt;Bede ''History of the English Church and People'' pp. 100â€“103&lt;/ref&gt; they refused to recognise him as their archbishop.&lt;ref name=Hindley8&gt;Hindley ''Brief History of the Anglo-Saxons'' pp. 8â€“9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Harting72/&gt; There were, however, deep differences between Augustine and the British church that perhaps played a more significant role in preventing an agreement. At issue were the tonsure, the observance of Easter, and practical and deep-rooted differences in approach to asceticism, missionary endeavours, and how the church itself was organised.&lt;ref name=ASE110/&gt; Some historians believe that Augustine had no real understanding of the history and traditions of the British church, damaging his relations with their bishops.&lt;ref name=Harting72&gt;Mayr-Harting ''Coming of Christianity'' pp. 72â€“73&lt;/ref&gt; Also, there were political dimensions involved, as Augustine's efforts were sponsored by the Kentish king, and at this period the Wessex and Mercian kingdoms were expanding to the west, into areas held by the Britons.&lt;ref name=Conversion119&gt;Yorke ''Conversion of Britain'' p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;

== Further success ==
Gregory also instructed Augustine on other matters. Temples were to be consecrated for Christian use,&lt;ref name=Thomson8&gt;Thomson ''Western Church'' p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; and feasts, if possible, moved to days celebrating Christian martyrs. One religious site was revealed to be a shrine of a local St Sixtus, whose worshippers were unaware of details of the martyr's life or death. They may have been native Christians, but Augustine did not treat them as such. When Gregory was informed, he told Augustine to stop the cult and use the shrine for the Roman [[Pope Sixtus II|St Sixtus]].&lt;ref name=Blair24&gt;Blair ''Church in Anglo-Saxon Society'' p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

Gregory legislated on the behaviour of the laity and the clergy. He placed the new mission directly under papal authority and made it clear that English bishops would have no authority over Frankish counterparts nor vice versa. Other directives dealt with the training of native clergy and the missionaries' conduct.&lt;ref name=ASE107&gt;Stenton ''Anglo-Saxon England'' pp. 107â€“108&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The King's School, Canterbury]] claims Augustine as its founder, which would make it the world's oldest existing school, but the first documentary records of the school date from the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kings-school.co.uk/document_1.aspx?id=1:31887&amp;id=1:31658&amp;id=1:31637 |title= 597 and all that: A Brief History of the King's School, Canterbury |accessdate=31 March 2008 |publisher=The King's School, Canterbury}}&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine did establish a school, and soon after his death Canterbury was able to send teachers out to support the [[East Anglia]]n mission.&lt;ref name=Brooks94&gt;Brooks ''Early History of the Church of Canterbury'' pp. 94â€“95&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine received [[liturgical book]]s from the pope, but their exact contents are unknown. They may have been some of the new mass books that were being written at this time. The exact liturgy that Augustine introduced to England remains unknown, but it would have been a form of the [[Latin]] language liturgy in use at Rome.&lt;ref name=Harting173&gt;Mayr-Harting ''Coming of Christianity'' pp. 173â€“174&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death and legacy ==
[[File:AgCant-tomb.jpg|thumb|left|Augustine's gravesite at Canterbury|alt=Pile of stones marked with a tag reading &quot;St. Augustine, Site of Grave, First Archbishop of Canterbury]]
Before his death, Augustine consecrated Laurence as his successor to the archbishopric, probably to ensure an orderly transfer of office.&lt;ref name=Hindley43&gt;Hindley ''Brief History of the Anglo-Saxons'' p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; Although at the time of Augustine's death, 26 May 604,&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; the mission barely extended beyond Kent, his undertaking introduced a more active missionary style into the British Isles. Despite the earlier presence of Christians in Ireland and Wales, no efforts had been made to try to convert the Saxon invaders. Augustine was sent to convert the descendants of those invaders, and eventually became the decisive influence in Christianity in the British Isles.&lt;ref name=ASE110/&gt;&lt;ref name=Collins185&gt;Collins ''Early Medieval Europe'' p. 185&lt;/ref&gt; Much of his success came about because of Augustine's close relationship with Ă†thelberht, which gave the archbishop time to establish himself.&lt;ref name=Harting249&gt;Mayr-Harting ''Coming of Christianity'' p. 249&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine's example also influenced the great missionary efforts of the Anglo-Saxon Church.&lt;ref name=Harting264&gt;Mayr-Harting ''Coming of Christianity'' pp. 265â€“266&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wood8&gt;Wood &quot;Mission of Augustine of Canterbury&quot; ''Speculum'' p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Augustine's body was originally buried in the portico of what is now St Augustine's, Canterbury,&lt;ref name=&quot;Blair61&quot; /&gt; but it was later exhumed and placed in a tomb within the abbey church, which became a place of pilgrimage and veneration. After the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman Conquest]] the cult of St Augustine was actively promoted.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; After the Conquest, his [[shrine]] in St Augustine's Abbey held a central position in one of the axial chapels, flanked by the shrines of his successors Laurence and Mellitus.&lt;ref name=Nilson67&gt;Nilson ''Cathedral Shrines'' p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; King [[Henry I of England]] granted St. Augustine's Abbey a six-day [[fair]] around the date on which Augustine's relics were [[Translation (relics)|translated]] to his new shrine, from 8 September through 13 September.&lt;ref name=Shrines&gt;Nilson ''Cathedral Shrines'' p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

A life of Augustine was written by [[Goscelin]] around 1090, but this life portrays Augustine in a different light than Bede's account. Goscelin's account has little new historical content, mainly being filled with miracles and imagined speeches.&lt;ref name=Gameson17&gt;Gameson and Gameson &quot;From Augustine to Parker&quot; ''Anglo-Saxons'' pp. 17â€“20&lt;/ref&gt; Building on this account, later medieval writers continued to add new miracles and stories to Augustine's life, often quite fanciful.&lt;ref name=Gameson19&gt;Gameson and Gameson &quot;From Augustine to Parker&quot; ''Anglo-Saxons'' p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; These authors included [[William of Malmesbury]], who claimed that Augustine founded [[Cerne Abbey]],&lt;ref name=Gameson20&gt;Gameson and Gameson &quot;From Augustine to Parker&quot; ''Anglo-Saxons'' p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; the author (generally believed to be [[John Brompton]]) of a late medieval chronicle containing invented letters from Augustine,&lt;ref name=Gameson24&gt;Gameson and Gameson &quot;From Augustine to Parker&quot; ''Anglo-Saxons'' p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; and a number of medieval writers who included Augustine in their [[Romance (heroic literature)|romances]].&lt;ref name=Gameson22&gt;Gameson and Gameson &quot;From Augustine to Parker&quot; ''Anglo-Saxons'' pp. 22â€“31&lt;/ref&gt; Another problem with investigating Augustine's saintly cult is the confusion resulting because most medieval liturgical documents mentioning Augustine do not distinguish between Augustine of Canterbury and [[Augustine of Hippo]], a fourth-century saint. Medieval Scandinavian liturgies feature Augustine of Canterbury quite often, however.&lt;ref name=Blair513&gt;Blair &quot;Handlist of Anglo-Saxon Saints&quot; ''Local Saints and Local Churches'' p. 513&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[English Reformation]], Augustine's shrine was destroyed and his relics were lost.

Augustine's shrine was re-established in March 2012 at the church of St. Augustine in [[Ramsgate]], Kent, very close to the mission's landing site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catholic-ew.org.uk/Home/News-Releases/Pugin-s-Church-becomes-Official-Shrine-of-St-Augustine |title= Pugin's Church becomes Official Shrine of St Augustine |accessdate=12 April 2012 |publisher=Catholic Church in England and Wales}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thisiskent.co.uk/Church-officially-deemed-shrine/story-15533122-detail/story.html|title= Church officially deemed a shrine|accessdate=12 April 2012 |publisher=Isle of Thanet Gazette}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[St Augustine's Cross]], a [[Celtic cross]] erected in 1884, marks the spot in [[Ebbsfleet, Thanet]], [[East Kent]], where Augustine is said to have landed.&lt;ref name=Cross&gt;{{cite web |author=English Heritage |publisher=National Monuments Records |url=http://www.pastscape.org/hob.aspx?hob_id=469595&amp;sort=4&amp;search=all&amp;criteria=st%20augustines%20cross&amp;rational=q&amp;recordsperpage=10 |year=2007 |accessdate=15 January 2011 |title=St Augustine's Cross |work=Pastscape}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Known as &quot;the Natural State&quot;, the diverse regions of Arkansas offer residents and tourists a variety of opportunities for outdoor recreation.

Arkansas is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|29th largest in square miles]] and the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population|32nd most populous]] of the [[50 United States]]. The capital and most populous city is [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]], located in the central portion of the state, a hub for transportation, business, culture, and government. The northwestern corner of the state, including the [[Fayettevilleâ€“Springdaleâ€“Rogers Metropolitan Area]] and [[Fort Smith metropolitan area]], is also an important population, education, and economic center. The largest city in the eastern part of the state is [[Jonesboro, Arkansas|Jonesboro]].

The [[Territory of Arkansas]] was [[admitted to the Union]] as the 25th state on June 15, 1836.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Cash |first= Marie |title= Arkansas Achieves Statehood |publisher= Arkansas Historical Association |work= Arkansas Historical Quarterly |volume= 2 | date= December 1943 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Arkansas withdrew from the United States and joined the [[Confederate States of America]] during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. Upon returning to the Union, the state would continue to suffer due to its earlier reliance on [[slavery]] and the [[plantation economy]], causing the state to fall behind economically and socially. [[White American|White]] rural interests continued to dominate the state's politics until [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955â€“1968)|the Civil Rights movement]] in the mid-20th century. Arkansas began to diversify its economy following [[World War II]] and now relies on its service industry as well as aircraft, poultry, steel and tourism in addition to cotton and rice.

The [[culture of Arkansas]] is observable in museums, theaters, novels, television shows, restaurants and athletic venues across the state. Despite a plethora of cultural, economic, and recreational opportunities, Arkansas is often stereotyped as a &quot;poor, banjo-picking hillbilly&quot; state, a reputation dating back to early accounts of the territory by frontiersmen in the early 1800s. Arkansas's enduring image has earned the state &quot;a special place in the American consciousness&quot;,{{Sfn | Blevins | 2009 | p = 4}} but it has in reality produced such prominent figures as politician and educational advocate [[William Fulbright]], former President [[Bill Clinton]], former [[NATO]] [[Supreme Allied Commander]], General [[Wesley Clark]], Walmart magnate [[Sam Walton]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Parker |first= Suzy |title= Arkansas's hillbilly image persists into 21st century |location= Little Rock, AR |date= September 25, 2011 |publisher = Reuters }}&lt;/ref&gt; and singer-songwriter [[Johnny Cash]].&lt;ref&gt;Cash, Johnny and Carr, Patrick  (1997) ''Johnny Cash the Autobiography'', Harper Collins. ISBN 0-06-101357-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The name Arkansas derives from the same root as the name for the [[state of Kansas]]. The [[Kaw (tribe)|Kansa]] tribe of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] are closely associated with the [[Sioux]] tribes of the [[Great Plains]]. The word &quot;Arkansas&quot; itself is a French pronunciation (&quot;Arcansas&quot;) of a [[Quapaw]] (a related &quot;Kaw&quot; tribe) word, ''akakaze'', meaning &quot;land of downriver people&quot; or the [[Sioux language|Sioux]] word ''akakaze'' meaning &quot;people of the south wind&quot;.

In 1881, the pronunciation of Arkansas with the final &quot;s&quot; being silent was made official by an act of the state legislature after a dispute arose between Arkansas's then-two U.S. senators as one favored the pronunciation as {{IPAc-en |Ë|É‘r|k|É™n|s|É”Ë}} {{respell |AR|kÉ™n-saw}} while the other favored {{IPAc-en |É‘r|Ë|k|Ă¦|n|z|É™|s}} {{respell|ar|KAN|zÉ™s}}.{{Refn | name=&quot;Arkansas&quot; | group = &quot;lower-alpha&quot; | The name Arkansas has been pronounced and spelled in a variety of fashions. The region was organized as the [[Territory of Arkansaw]] on July 4, 1819, but the territory was admitted to the United States as the state of Arkansas on June 15, 1836. The name was historically {{IPAc-en|Ë|É‘r|k|É™n|s|É”Ë}}, {{IPAc-en|É‘r|Ë|k|Ă¦|n|z|É™|s}}, and several other variants. Historically and modernly, the people of Arkansas call themselves either &quot;Arkansans&quot; or &quot;Arkansawyers&quot;. In 1881, the [[Arkansas General Assembly]] passed the following concurrent resolution, now Arkansas Code 1 April 105:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = http://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/assembly/ArkansasCode/0/1-4-105.htm | format = official text | title = Code | place = AR, [[United States of America|US]] | publisher = Assembly | issue = 1â€4â€105 | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

&lt;p&gt;And, whereas, the matter has been thoroughly investigated by the State Historical Society and the Eclectic Society of Little Rock, which have agreed upon the correct pronunciation as derived from history, and the early usage of the American immigrants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be it therefore resolved by both houses of the General Assembly, that the only true pronunciation of the name of the state, in the opinion of this body, is that received by the French from the native Indians and committed to writing in the French word representing the sound. It should be pronounced in three (3) syllables, with the final &quot;s&quot; silent, the &quot;a&quot; in each syllable with the Italian sound, and the accent on the first and last syllables. The pronunciation with the accent on the second syllable with the sound of &quot;a&quot; in &quot;man&quot; and the sounding of the terminal &quot;s&quot; is discouraged by Arkansans.&lt;/p&gt;}}

Citizens of the [[state of Kansas]] often pronounce the [[Arkansas River]] as {{IPAc-en |É‘r|Ë|k|Ă¦|n|z|É™|s|_|Ë|r|ÉŞ|v|É™r}}, in a manner similar to the common pronunciation of the name of their state.}}

In 2007, the state legislature passed a non-binding resolution declaring the possessive form of the state's name to be ''Arkansas's'' which has been followed increasingly by the state government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Gambrell |first= John |url= http://www2.arkansasonline.com/news/2007/mar/13/senate-gives-support-possessive-form-arkansas/ |title= Senate gives support to possessive form of Arkansas |publisher=[[Arkansas Democrat Gazette]] |date= March 13, 2007 |accessdate= June 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Boundaries===
Arkansas borders [[Louisiana]] to the south, [[Texas]] to the southwest, [[Oklahoma]] to the west, [[Missouri]] to the north, and [[Tennessee]] and [[Mississippi]] on the east. The [[United States Census Bureau]] classifies Arkansas as a [[Southern United States|southern]] state, sub-categorized among the [[West South Central States]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wsc&quot; /&gt; The [[Mississippi River]] forms most of Arkansas's eastern border, except in [[Clay County, Arkansas|Clay]] and [[Greene County, Arkansas|Greene]], counties where the [[St. Francis River]] forms the western boundary of the [[Missouri Bootheel]], and in many places where the current channel of the Mississippi has meandered from where its original legal designation. The state line along the Mississippi River is indeterminate along much of the eastern border with Mississippi due to these meanders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite map |publisher = DeLorme |title = Arkansas Atlas and Gazetteer |edition = Second }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terrain===
Arkansas can generally be split into two halves, the highlands in the northwest half and the lowlands of the southeastern half.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 1989, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; The highlands are part of the Southern Interior Highlands, including [[The Ozarks]] and the [[Ouachita Mountains]]. The southern lowlands include the [[Gulf Coastal Plain]] and the [[Arkansas Delta]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith 1989, pp. 15-17.&lt;/ref&gt; This dual split is somewhat simplistic, however, and thus usually yields to general regions named northwest, southwest, northeast, southeast, or central Arkansas. These directionally named regions are also not defined along county lines and are also broad. Arkansas has seven distinct natural regions: the Ozark Mountains, Ouachita Mountains, [[Arkansas River Valley]], Gulf Coastal Plain, [[Crowley's Ridge]], and the Arkansas Delta, with [[Central Arkansas]] sometimes included as a blend of multiple regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Arkansas Regions |url= http://www.arkansasheritage.com/discover/natural_environments/regions.aspx |work= Discover Arkansas History |publisher= The Department of Arkansas Heritage |accessdate= June 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The southeastern part of Arkansas along the [[Mississippi Alluvial Plain]] is sometimes called the Arkansas Delta. This region is a flat landscape of [[River delta|rich alluvial soils formed by repeated flooding]] of the adjacent Mississippi. Farther away from the river, in the southeast portion of the state, the Grand Prairie consists of a more undulating landscape. Both are fertile agricultural areas. The Delta region is bisected by an unusual geological formation known as [[Crowley's Ridge]]. A narrow band of rolling hills, Crowley's Ridge rises from {{convert|250|to|500|ft|m}} above the surrounding alluvial plain and underlies many of the major towns of eastern Arkansas.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 1989, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Northwest Arkansas is part of the [[Ozark Plateau]] including the Ozark Mountains, to the south are the Ouachita Mountains, and these regions are divided by the [[Arkansas River]]; the southern and eastern parts of Arkansas are called the Lowlands.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Writers' Project 1987, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; These mountain ranges are part of the [[U.S. Interior Highlands]] region, the only major mountainous region between the [[Rocky Mountains]] and the [[Appalachian Mountains]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title= Ozark Mountains |publisher= EncyclopĂ¦dia Britannica |url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/437144/Ozark-Mountains |accessdate= January 2, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The highest point in the state is [[Mount Magazine]] in the [[Ouachita Mountains]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Arkansasâ€™s Highpoint Information |url= http://www.arkansasstateparks.com/!userfiles/pdfs/MM%20Highpoint%20bro%2005.pdf |format =  PDF |publisher= [[Arkansas Department of Parks and Tourism]] |accessdate= January 2, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it rises to {{convert|2753|ft|m}} above sea level.&lt;ref name=&quot;sh&quot; /&gt;

===Hydrology===
[[File:Buffalo National River.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Buffalo National River]] is one of many attractions that give the state its nickname, ''The Natural State''.]]
Arkansas has many rivers, lakes, and reservoirs within or along its borders. Major tributaries of the Mississippi River include the Arkansas River, [[White River (Arkansas)|White River]], and [[St. Francis River]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Federal Writers 1987, p. 8&quot;&gt;Federal Writers' Project 1987, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; The Arkansas is fed by the [[Mulberry River (Arkansas)|Mulberry River]], and [[Fourche La Fave River|Fourche LaFave River]] in the Arkansas River Valley, which is also home to [[Lake Dardanelle]]. The [[Buffalo National River|Buffalo River]], [[Little Red River (Arkansas)|Little Red River]], [[Black River (Arkansas)|Black River]] and [[Cache River (Arkansas)|Cache River]] all serve as tributaries to the [[White River (Arkansas)|White River]], which also empties into the Mississippi. The [[Saline River (Ouachita River)|Saline River]], [[Little Missouri River (Arkansas)|Little Missouri River]], [[Bayou Bartholomew]], and the [[Caddo River]] all serve as tributaries to the [[Ouachita River]] in south Arkansas, [[Old River Control Structure|which eventually empties into the Mississippi]] in Louisiana. The [[Red River of the South|Red River]] briefly serves as the state's boundary with Texas.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 1989, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Arkansas has few natural lakes but many major reservoirs, including [[Bull Shoals Lake]], [[Lake Ouachita]], [[Greers Ferry Lake]], [[Millwood Lake]], [[Beaver Lake (Arkansas)|Beaver Lake]], [[Norfork Lake]], [[DeGray Lake]], and [[Lake Conway]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith 1989, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Arkansas is home to many [[List of caves in Arkansas|caves]], such as [[Blanchard Springs Caverns]]. More than 43,000 Native American living, hunting and tool making sites, many of them Pre-Columbian burial mounds and rock shelters, have been cataloged by the State Archeologist.

===Flora and fauna===
[[File:White River, Arkansas.jpg|right|thumb|The [[White River (Arkansas)|White River]] in eastern Arkansas]]
Arkansas is divided into three broad ecoregions, the ''Ozark, Ouachita-Appalachian Forests'', ''Mississippi Alluvial and Southeast USA Coastal Plains'', and the ''Southeastern USA Plains''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite map |title= Ecological Regions of North America |scale= 1:10000000 |url= ftp://ftp.epa.gov/wed/ecoregions/cec_na/NA_LEVEL_II.pdf |type =  PDF |publisher= United States Environmental Protection Agency |accessdate= July 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The state is further divided into seven subregions: the Arkansas Valley, [[Boston Mountains]], [[Mississippi Alluvial Plain]], [[Crowley's Ridge|Mississippi Valley Loess Plain]], Ozark Highlands, Ouachita Mountains, and the South Central Plains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite map |title= Ecoregions of Arkansas |url= ftp://ftp.epa.gov/wed/ecoregions/ar/ar_eco_pg.pdf |type =  PDF |publisher= United States Environmental Protection Agency |accessdate= July 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2010 [[United States Forest Service]] survey determined {{convert|18720000|acre|ha}} of Arkansas's land is forestland, or 56% of the state's total area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Forest Inventory and Analysis |url= http://srsfia2.fs.fed.us/states/ar/tables/AR_2010-FS_FIADB_22JUNE2011.xls |format =  XLS |year= 2010 |publisher= United States Forest Service, Southern Research Station |accessdate= July 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dominant species in Arkansas's forests include ''[[Oak|Quercus]]'' (oak), ''[[Hickory|Carya]]'' (hickory), ''[[Pinus echinata]]'' (shortleaf pine) and ''[[Pinus taeda]]'' (Loblolly pine).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Proceedings of the Symposium on Arkansas Forests: A Conference on the Results of the Recent Forest Survey of Arkansas |publisher= [[United States Forest Service]] |date= May 30â€“31, 1997 |page= 74 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Dale, Jr |first1= Edward E. |last2= Ware |first2= Stewart |title= Distribution of Wetland Tree Species in Relation to a Flooding Gradient and Backwater versus Streamside Location in Arkansas, U.S.A |date= Aprilâ€“June 2004 |work= Journal of the Torrey Botanical Society |volume= 131 |pages= 177â€“186 |publisher= Torrey Botanical Society }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arkansas's plant life varies with its climate and elevation. The [[Arkansas Timberlands|pine belt]] stretching from the Arkansas delta to Texas consists of dense oak-hickory-pine growth. Lumbering and paper milling activity is active throughout the region.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Writers' Project 1987, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; In eastern Arkansas, one can find ''[[Taxodium]] '' (cypress), ''[[Quercus nigra]]'' (water oaks), and hickories with their roots submerged in the Mississippi Valley bayous indicative of the deep south.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Writers' Project 1987, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Nearby Crowley's Ridge is only home of the [[Liriodendron|tulip tree]] in the state, and generally hosts more northeastern plant life such as the [[beech]] tree.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Writers' Project 1987, pp. 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt; The northwestern highlands are covered in an oak-hickory mixture, with [[Juniperus flaccida|Ozark white cedar]]s, ''[[Cornus (genus)|cornus]]'' (dogwoods), and ''[[Cercis canadensis]]'' (redbuds) also present. The higher peaks in the Arkansas River Valley play host to scores of ferns, including the ''[[Woodsia scopulina]]'' and ''[[Adiantum]]'' (maidenhair fern) on Mount Magazine.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Writers' Project 1987, pp. 13-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate===
[[File:Devil's Den bridge.jpg|right|thumb|[[Devil's Den State Park]] is a popular state park in [[Washington County, Arkansas|Washington County]] for enjoying autumn foliage.]]
Arkansas generally has a [[humid subtropical climate]], which borders on [[humid continental climate|humid continental]] in some northern highland areas. While not bordering the [[Gulf of Mexico]], Arkansas is still close enough to this warm, large body of water for it to influence the weather in the state. Generally, Arkansas has hot, humid summers and cold, slightly drier winters. In [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]], the daily high temperatures average around {{convert|93|Â°F|Â°C|abbr=on}} with lows around {{convert|73|Â°F|Â°C|abbr=on}} in July. In January highs average around {{convert|51|Â°F|Â°C|abbr=on}} and lows around {{convert|32|Â°F|Â°C|abbr=on}}. In [[Siloam Springs, Arkansas|Siloam Springs]] in the northwest part of the state, the average high and low temperatures in July are {{convert|89|and|67|Â°F|Â°C|abbr=on}} and in January the average high and lows are {{convert|44|and|23|Â°F|Â°C|abbr=on}}. Annual precipitation throughout the state averages between about {{convert|40|and|60|in|mm}}; somewhat wetter in the south and drier in the northern part of the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Climate in Arkansas |url= http://www.city-data.com/states/Arkansas-Climate.html |publisher= City-data |accessdate= January 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Snowfall is infrequent but most common in the northern half of the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;Federal Writers 1987, p. 8&quot;/&gt; The half of the state south of Little Rock is more apt to see ice storms. Arkansas' all-time record high is {{convert|120|F|C}} at [[Ozark, Arkansas|Ozark]] on August 10, 1936; the all-time record low is {{convert|-29|F|C}} at [[Gravette, Arkansas|Gravette]], on February 13, 1905.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= State Climate Records |url= http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/extremes/scec/records |date= July 23, 2012 |publisher= National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Climatic Data Center |work= State Climate Extremes Committee |accessdate= January 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arkansas is known for extreme weather and many storms. A typical year will see thunderstorms, tornadoes, hail, snow and ice storms. Between both the [[Great Plains]] and the [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf States]], Arkansas receives around 60 days of thunderstorms. A few of the most destructive tornadoes in U.S. history have struck the state. While being sufficiently away from the coast to be safe from a direct hit from a hurricane, Arkansas can often get the remnants of a [[tropical cyclone|tropical system]] which dumps tremendous amounts of rain in a short time and often spawns smaller tornadoes.

{{Main|History of Arkansas}}

===Early Arkansas through territorial period===
[[File:Chromesun toltec mounds photo01.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tumulus|Burial mounds]], such as this one at [[Toltec Mounds Archeological State Park]] in northeast Arkansas, became more common during the [[Woodland Period]].]]
Prior to European settlement of North America, Arkansas was inhabited by the [[Caddo]], [[Osage Nation|Osage]], and [[Quapaw]] people. Explorers to visit the state include [[Hernando de Soto (explorer)|Hernando de Soto]] in 1541, [[Jacques Marquette]] and [[Louis Jolliet]] in 1673, and [[Robert La Salle]] and [[Henri de Tonti]] in 1681.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Sabo III |first= George |title= First Encounters, Hernando de Soto in the Mississippi Valley, 1541-42 |url=http://arkarcheology.uark.edu/indiansofarkansas/index.html?pageName=First%20Encounters |date= December 12, 2008 |accessdate= May 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher 1989, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Originally a Quapaw village, [[Arkansas Post National Memorial|Arkansas Post]] was the first European settlement upon its establishment by de Tonti in 1686, in the name of King [[Louis XIV of France]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ce&quot;&gt;Arnold 1992, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; As Europeans settled the east coast, many other [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes were relocated to Arkansas. Settlers, including fur trappers, moved to Arkansas in the early 18th century. These people used Arkansas Post as a home base and [[entrepĂ´t]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ce&quot; /&gt; During the colonial period, Arkansas changed hands between [[France]] and [[Spain]] following the [[Seven Years' War]], although neither showed interest in the remote settlement of Arkansas Post.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold et al. 2002, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1783, Arkansas saw its only battle of the [[American Revolutionary War]], a brief [[Battle of Arkansas Post (American Revolutionary War)|siege]] of the post by British Captain James Colbert with the assistance of the [[Choctaw]] and [[Chickasaw]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Din |first= Gilbert C. |title= Arkansas Post in the American Revolution |work= The Arkansas Historical Quarterly |publisher= Arkansas Historical Association |date= Spring 1981 |volume= 40 |pages= 17â€“28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The early Spanish or French explorers of the state gave it its name, which is probably a phonetic spelling of the [[Illinois language|Illinois]] tribe's name for the [[Quapaw]] people, who lived downriver from them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0302b&amp;L=ads-l&amp;P=7800 |title=Linguist list 14.4 |publisher=Listserv.linguistlist.org |date=February 11, 2003 |accessdate=July 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Arkansas&quot; group = &quot;lower-alpha&quot; /&gt;

[[Napoleon Bonaparte]] sold [[Louisiana (New France)|French Louisiana]] to the United States in 1803, including all of Arkansas, in a transaction known today as the [[Louisiana Purchase]], although French soldiers remained at [[Arkansas Post National Memorial|Arkansas Post]]. Following the purchase, the balanced give-and-take relationship between settlers and Native Americans began to change all along the frontier, including in Arkansas.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold et al. 2002, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; Following [[Missouri compromise|a controversy over allowing slavery in the territory]], the [[Territory of Arkansas]] was organized on July 4, 1819.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arkansas&quot; group = &quot;lower-alpha&quot; /&gt; Gradual emancipation in Arkansas was struck down by one vote, the [[Speaker of the House]] [[Henry Clay]], allowing Arkansas to organize as a slave territory.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson 1965, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; Slavery became a wedge issue in Arkansas, forming a geographic divide that remained for decades.  The owners and operators of the cotton [[plantation economy]] in southeast Arkansas firmly supported slavery, as [[Slavery|slave labor]] was perceived by them to be the best or &quot;only&quot; economically viable method of harvesting their crop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Bolton |first= S.

===Statehood, Civil War and Reconstruction===
[[File:Lakeport Plantation, Lake Village, Chicot County, Arkansas.jpg|right|thumb|[[Lakeport Plantation]], c. 1859 and built south of [[Lake Village, Arkansas|Lake Village]], is the only remaining antebellum plantation house on the Mississippi River in Arkansas. Many planters became wealthy from the [[cotton]] industry in southern Arkansas.]]
When Arkansas applied for statehood, the slavery issue was again raised in [[Washington DC]]. Congress eventually approved the [[Arkansas Constitution]] after a 25-hour session, admitting Arkansas on June 15, 1836 as the 25th state and the 13th [[slave state]], having a population of about 60,000.&lt;ref&gt;Scroggs 1961, p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt; Arkansas struggled with taxation to support its new state government, a problem made worse by [[Holford Bonds|a state banking scandal]] and worse yet by the [[Panic of 1837]]. In early antebellum Arkansas, the southeast Arkansas economy grew rapidly on the backs of slaves. On the eve of the Civil War in 1860, enslaved African Americans numbered 111,115 people, just over 25% of the state's population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fisher.lib.virginia.edu/collections/stats/histcensus/php/state.php Historical Census Browser, 1860 US Census, University of Virginia]. Retrieved March 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; However, plantation agriculture would ultimately set the state and region behind the nation for decades.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold et al. 2002, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; The growth of southeast Arkansas also caused a rift to form between the northwest and southeast.&lt;ref name=&quot;bol&quot;&gt;Bolton 1999, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many politicians were elected to office from [[The Family (Arkansas politics)|the Family]], the Southern rights political force in antebellum Arkansas, but the populace generally wanted to avoid a civil war. When the Gulf states seceded in early 1861, Arkansas voted to remain in the Union.&lt;ref name=&quot;bol&quot; /&gt; Arkansas did not secede until [[Abraham Lincoln]] demanded Arkansas troops be sent to [[Fort Sumter]] to quell [[Battle of Fort Sumter|the rebellion there]]. The following month a state convention voted to terminate Arkansas's membership in the Union and join the [[Confederate States of America]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bol&quot; /&gt; Arkansas held a very important position for the Rebels, maintaining control of the [[Mississippi River]] and surrounding Southern states. The bloody [[Battle of Wilson's Creek]] just across the border in Missouri shocked many Arkansans who thought the war would be a quick and decisive Southern victory. Battles early in the war took place in northwest Arkansas, including the [[Battle of Cane Hill]], [[Battle of Pea Ridge]], and [[Battle of Prairie Grove]]. Union General [[Samuel Ryan Curtis|Samuel Curtis]] swept across the state to [[Helena-West Helena, Arkansas|Helena]] in 1862. Little Rock was captured the following year, forcing the Confederate capital to move to [[Hot Springs, Arkansas|Hot Springs]], and then again to [[Washington, Arkansas|Washington]] from 1863-1865, for the remainder of the war. Throughout the state, guerrilla warfare ravaged the countryside and destroyed cities.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold et al. 2002, p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt; Passion for the Confederate cause waned after implementation of unpopular programs like a draft, high taxes, and martial law.

Under the [[Reconstruction era of the United States#Military reconstruction|Military Reconstruction Act]], Congress declared Arkansas restored to the Union in June 1868. The Republican-controlled reconstruction legislature established universal male suffrage (though temporarily disfranchising all former Confederates, who were mostly Democrats), a public education system, and passed general issues to improve the state and help more of the population. The state soon came under almost exclusive control of the [[Radical Republicans]], (those who moved in from the North being derided as &quot;[[carpetbaggers]]&quot; based on allegations of corruption), and led by Governor [[Powell Clayton]], they presided over a time of great upheaval and racial violence in the state between Republican state militia and the [[Ku Klux Klan]].

In 1874, the [[Brooks-Baxter War]], a political struggle between factions of the [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] shook Little Rock and the state governorship. It was settled only when President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] ordered [[Joseph Brooks (politician)|Joseph Brooks]] to disperse his militant supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=2276 |title=Brooks-Baxter War â€“ Encyclopedia of Arkansas |accessdate=August 24, 2007| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20070929091926/http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=2276| archivedate= September 29, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the Brooks-Baxter War, a new state constitution was ratified, re-enfranchising former Confederates.

In 1881, the Arkansas state legislature enacted a bill that adopted an official pronunciation of the state's name, to combat a controversy then simmering. (See Law and Government below.)

After Reconstruction, the state began to receive more immigrants and migrants. Chinese, [[Italians|Italian]], and [[Syrian]] men were recruited for farm labor in the developing Delta region. None of these nationalities stayed long at farm labor; the Chinese especially quickly became small merchants in towns around the Delta. Some early 20th-century immigration included people from eastern Europe. Together, these immigrants made the Delta more diverse than the rest of the state. In the same years, some black migrants moved into the area because of opportunities to develop the bottomlands and own their own property. Many Chinese became such successful merchants in small towns that they were able to educate their children at college.&lt;ref&gt;William D.

Construction of railroads enabled more farmers to get their products to market. It also brought new development into different parts of the state, including the Ozarks, where some areas were developed as resorts. In a few years at the end of the 19th century, for instance, [[Eureka Springs]] in [[Carroll County, Arkansas|Carroll County]] grew to 10,000 people, rapidly becoming a tourist destination and the fourth-largest city of the state. It featured newly constructed, elegant resort hotels and spas planned around its natural springs, considered to have healthful properties. The town's attractions included horse racing and other entertainment. It appealed to a wide variety of classes, becoming almost as popular as [[Hot Springs, Arkansas|Hot Springs]].

In the late 1880s, the worsening agricultural depression catalyzed Populist and third party movements, leading to interracial coalitions. Struggling to stay in power, in the 1890s the Democrats in Arkansas followed other Southern states in passing legislation and constitutional amendments that [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchised]] blacks and poor whites. Democrats wanted to prevent their alliance. In 1891 state legislators passed a requirement for a [[literacy test]], knowing that many blacks and whites would be excluded, at a time when more than 25% of the population could neither read nor write. In 1892 they amended the state constitution to include a [[poll tax]] and more complex residency requirements, both of which adversely affected poor people and sharecroppers, and forced them from voter rolls.

By 1900 the Democratic Party expanded use of the [[white primary]] in county and state elections, further denying blacks a part in the political process. Only in the primary was there any competition among candidates, as Democrats held all the power. The state was a Democratic one-party state for decades, until after the federal [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] were passed by Congress.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oldstatehouse.com/educational_programs/classroom/arkansas_news/detail.asp?id=800&amp;issue_id=36&amp;page=3 &quot;White Primary&quot; System Bars Blacks from Politics â€“ 1900&quot;, ''The Arkansas News'', Old State House, Spring 1987, p.3. Retrieved March 22, 2008.]{{dead link|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1905 and 1911, Arkansas began to receive a small immigration of [[Germans|German]], [[Slovaks|Slovak]], and Scots-Irish from Europe. The German and Slovak peoples settled in the eastern part of the state known as the [[Prairie]], and the Irish founded small communities in the southeast part of the state. The Germans were mostly Lutheran and the Slovaks were primarily Catholic. The Irish were mostly Protestant from [[Ulster]], of Scots and Northern Borders descent.

After the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]'s decision in [[Brown v. Board of Education|''Brown ''v.'' Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas'']] in 1954, the [[Little Rock Nine]] brought Arkansas to national attention when the Federal government intervened to protect African-American students trying to integrate a high school in the Arkansas capital. Governor [[Orval Faubus]] ordered the [[Arkansas National Guard]] to aid segregationists in preventing nine African-American students from enrolling at Little Rock's Central High School. After attempting three times to contact Faubus, President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] sent 1000 troops from the active-duty 101st Airborne Division to escort and protect the African-American students as they entered school on September 25, 1957. In defiance of federal court orders to integrate, the governor and city of Little Rock decided to close the high schools for the remainder of the school year. By the fall of 1959, the Little Rock high schools were completely integrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?search=1&amp;entryID=723 |title=Little Rock Nine â€“ Encyclopedia of Arkansas |accessdate=August 24, 2007| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20070929115012/http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?search=1&amp;entryID=723| archivedate= September 29, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bill Clinton]], the 42nd President of the United States, was born in [[Hope, Arkansas]]. Before his presidency, Clinton served as the 40th and 42nd [[Governor of Arkansas]], a total of nearly 12 years.

The state recorded growth in each successive decade, although slowing until recording losses in the [[1950 United States Census|1950]] and [[1960 United States Census|1960 Censuses]]. This outmigration was a result of multiple factors, including mechanization on the farm reducing the number of laborers needed and young educated people leaving the state due to a lack of non-farming industry in the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Holley |first= Donald |title= Leaving the Land of Opportunity: Arkansas and the Great Migration |work= Arkansas Historical Quarterly |volume= 64 |pages= 247â€“248 |date= Autumn 2005 |publisher= Arkansas Historical Association }}&lt;/ref&gt; Arkansas again began to grow, recording positive growth rates ever since and exceeding the 2 million mark during the [[1980 United States Census|1980 Census]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Resident Population Data |publisher= United States Census Bureau |url= http://2010.census.gov/2010census/data/apportionment-pop-text.php |accessdate= July 4, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Arkansas's current rate of change, age distributions, and gender distributions mirror national averages.

European Americans have a strong presence in the northwestern [[Ozarks]] and the central part of the state. African Americans live mainly in the southern and eastern parts of the state. Arkansans of Irish, English and German ancestry are mostly found in the far northwestern Ozarks near the Missouri border. Ancestors of the Irish in the Ozarks were chiefly [[Ulster Scots people|Scots-Irish]], Protestants from [[Northern Ireland]], the [[Scotland|Scottish]] lowlands and northern England part of the largest group of immigrants from [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]] before the American Revolution. [[English American|English]] and [[Scots-Irish American|Scots-Irish]] immigrants settled throughout the backcountry of the South and in the more mountainous areas. Americans of [[English American|English]] stock are found throughout the state.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Hackett Fischer]], ''[[Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America]]'', New York: Oxford University Press, 1989, pp.633â€“639&lt;/ref&gt;

The principal ancestries of Arkansas's residents in 2010 were surveyed to be the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= American FactFinder, United States Census Bureau |url= http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_10_1YR_CP02&amp;prodType=table |title= Arkansas â€“ Selected Social Characteristics in the United States |year= 2010 |publisher= [[American Community Survey]] |accessdate= July 4, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the people of American ancestry have some English descent and some have Scots-Irish descent. Their families have been in the state so long, in many cases since before statehood, that they choose to identify simply as having American ancestry or do not in fact know their own ancestry. Their ancestry primarily goes back to the original 13 colonies and for this reason many of them today simply claim American ancestry. Many people who identify themselves as Irish descent are in fact of Scots-Irish descent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SVoAXh-dNuYC&amp;pg=PA57&amp;dq=Sharing+the+dream:+white+males+in+multicultural+America++english+ancestry&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Sharing the Dream: White Males in a Multicultural America] By Dominic J.

According to the 2006â€“2008 American Community Survey, 93.8% of Arkansas' population (over the age of five) spoke only English at home. About 4.5% of the state's population spoke Spanish at home. About 0.7% of the state's population spoke any other [[Indo-European language]]s. About 0.8% of the state's population spoke an [[Languages of Asia|Asian language]], and 0.2% spoke other languages.

===Religion===
Arkansas, like most other Southern states, is part of the [[Bible Belt]] and is predominantly Protestant. The largest denominations by number of adherents in 2010 were the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] with 661,382; the [[United Methodist Church]] with 158,574; non-denominational Evangelical Protestants with 129,638; and the [[Catholic Church]] with 122,662. However, there are some residents of the state who live by other religions such as [[Wiccan]], [[Pagan]], [[Islam]], [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]] and still others who prefer no religious denomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thearda.com/rcms2010/r/s/05/rcms2010_05_state_adh_2010.asp |title=The Association of Religion Data Archives &amp;#124; State membership Report |publisher=www.Thearda.com |accessdate=November 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once a state with a cashless society in the uplands and [[Plantation economy|plantation]] agriculture in the lowlands, Arkansas's economy has evolved and diversified to meet the needs of today's consumer.

===Industry and commerce===
Arkansas's earliest industries were [[fur trading]] and agriculture, with development of cotton [[plantations]] in the areas near the Mississippi River. They were dependent on slave labor through the [[American Civil War]].

Today only approximately 3% of the population is employed in the agricultural sector,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Selected Economic Characteristics 2006-2010 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates |publisher= United States Census Bureau |url= http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_10_5YR_DP03&amp;prodType=table |year= 2011 |accessdate= October 4, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it remains a major part of the state's economy, ranking 13th in the nation in the value of products sold.&lt;ref name=&quot;agcensus&quot;&gt;{{cite web |work= Census of Agriculture |title= Arkansas State Profile |publisher= United States Department of Agriculture |url= http://www.agcensus.usda.gov/Publications/2007/Online_Highlights/County_Profiles/Arkansas/cp99005.pdf |year= 2007 |accessdate= October 4, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The state is the U.S.'s largest producer of rice, [[broiler]]s, and turkeys,&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Agriculture, National Agricultural Statistics Service, ''Poultry &amp;ndash; Production and Value, 2010 Summary'', data indicates Arkansas led the nation in 2008, 2009, and 2010, in both broilers and turkeys.&lt;/ref&gt; and ranks in the top three for [[cotton]], [[pullets]], and aquaculture (catfish).&lt;ref name=&quot;agcensus&quot; /&gt; Forestry remains strong in the [[Arkansas Timberlands]], and the state ranks fourth nationally and first in the South in softwood lumber production.&lt;ref name=&quot;agcensus&quot;&gt;{{cite web |first= Matthew H. |last= Pelkki |title= An Economic Assessment of Arkansasâ€™ Forest Industries: Challenges and Opportunities for the 21st Century |publisher= University of Arkansas-Monticello School of Forest Resources, Arkansas Forest Resources Center, University of Arkansas Division of Agriculture |url= http://arkansasagnews.uark.edu/afrc-007.2.1-20.pdf |format = PDF |accessdate= October 4, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, automobile parts manufacturers have opened factories in eastern Arkansas to support auto plants in other states. [[Bauxite]] was formerly a large part of the state's economy, mined mostly around [[Saline County, Arkansas|Saline County]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= William V. |last=Bush |title= History of Bauxite in Arkansas |url= http://www.geology.arkansas.gov/pdf/pamphlets/Bauxite.pdf |publisher= Arkansas Geological Survey |format = PDF |accessdate= October 4, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tourism is also very important to the Arkansas economy; the official state nickname &quot;The Natural State&quot; was created for state tourism advertising in the 1970s, and is still used to this day. The state maintains [[List of Arkansas state parks|52 state parks]] and the [[National Park Service]] maintains seven properties in Arkansas. The completion of the [[William Jefferson Clinton Presidential Library]] in Little Rock has drawn many visitors to the city and revitalized the nearby [[Little Rock River Market District|River Market District]]. Many cities also hold festivals which draw tourists to the culture of Arkansas, such as [[King Biscuit Blues Festival]], [[Ozark Folk Center|Ozark Folk Festival]], [[Toad Suck Daze]], and [[Tontitown, Arkansas|Tontitown Grape Festival]].

{{Main|Culture of Arkansas}}
The culture of Arkansas is available to all in various forms, whether it be architecture, literature, or fine and performing arts. The state's culture also includes distinct cuisine, dialect, and traditional festivals. Sports are also very important to the culture of Arkansas, ranging from football, baseball, and basketball to hunting and fishing. Perhaps the best-known piece of Arkansas's culture is the stereotype of its citizens as shiftless hillbillies.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold et al. 2002, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; The reputation began when the state was characterized by early explorers as a savage wilderness full of outlaws and thieves.&lt;ref&gt;Blevins 2009, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; The most enduring icon of Arkansas's hillbilly reputation is ''[[Edward Washburn|The Arkansas Traveller]]'', a painted depiction of a folk tale from the 1840s.&lt;ref&gt;Blevins 2009, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Although intended to represent the divide between rich southeastern plantation Arkansas planters and the poor northwestern hill country, the meaning was twisted to represent a Northerner lost in the Ozarks on a white horse asking a backwoods Arkansan for directions.&lt;ref&gt;Sutherlin 1996, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; The state also suffers from the racial stigma common to former Confederate states, with historical events such as the [[Little Rock Nine]] adding to Arkansas's enduring image.&lt;ref&gt;Sutherlin 1996, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Art and history museums display pieces of cultural value for Arkansans and tourists to enjoy. [[Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art]] in [[Bentonville, Arkansas|Bentonville]] is the most popular with 604,000 visitors in 2012, its first year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= 600K visitors later, Crystal Bridges turns 1 |last= Bartels |first= Chuck |url= http://www.seattlepi.com/news/article/600K-visitors-later-Crystal-Bridges-is-1-year-old-4030447.php |date= November 12, 2012 |accessdate= November 18, 2012 |publisher= Seattle Post-Intelligencer }}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum includes walking trails and educational opportunities in addition to displaying over 450 works covering five centuries of American art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Crystal Bridges art museum is reshaping Wal-Mart's hometown |last= Reynolds |first= Chris |publisher= Chicago Tribune |url= http://www.chicagotribune.com/travel/la-tr-arkansas-20121014,0,3925043.story?page=2 |date= October 14, 2012 |accessdate= November 18, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several historic town sites have been restored as Arkansas [[List of Arkansas state parks|state parks]], including [[Historic Washington State Park]], [[Powhatan Historic State Park]], and [[Davidsonville Historic State Park]].

Arkansas features a variety of native music across the state, ranging from the [[blues]] heritage of [[West Memphis, Arkansas|West Memphis]] and [[Helena-West Helena, Arkansas|Helena-West Helena]] to [[rockabilly]], [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]], and folk music from the Ozarks. Festivals such as the [[King Biscuit Blues Festival]] and [[Bikes, Blues, and BBQ]] pay homage to the history of blues in the state. The Ozark Folk Festival in [[Mountain View, Arkansas|Mountain View]] is a celebration of Ozark culture and often features folk and bluegrass musicians. Literature set in Arkansas such as ''[[I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings]]'' by [[Maya Angelou]] and ''[[A Painted House]]'' by [[John Grisham]] describe the culture at various time periods.

===Sports and recreation===

Sports are an integral part of the culture of Arkansas, and her residents enjoy participating in and spectating various events throughout the year. One of the oldest sports in Arkansas is hunting. The state created the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission in 1915 to regulate and enforce hunting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Griffee |first= Carol |title= Odyssey Of Survival, A History of the Arkansas Conservation Sales Tax |page= 10 |url= http://www.teaming.com/sites/default/files/REPORT%20Odyssey%20of%20Survival-%20A%20History%20of%20the%20AR%20Conservation%20Sales%20Tax.pdf |format =  PDF |accessdate= September 16, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today a significant portion of Arkansas's population participates in hunting [[duck]] in the [[Mississippi flyway]] and [[deer]] across the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sutherlin 1996, p. 164&quot;&gt;Sutherlin 1996, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; Millions of acres of public land are available for both bow and modern gun hunters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sutherlin 1996, p. 164&quot;/&gt;

Fishing has always been popular in Arkansas, and the sport and the state have benefited from the creation of reservoirs across the state. Following the completion of [[Norfork Dam]], the [[Norfork Tailwater]] and the [[White River (Arkansas)|White River]] have become a destination for [[trout]] fishers. Several smaller retirement communities such as [[Bull Shoals, Arkansas|Bull Shoals]], [[Hot Springs Village, Arkansas|Hot Springs Village]], and [[Fairfield Bay, Arkansas|Fairfield Bay]] have flourished due to their position on a fishing lake. The [[Buffalo National River]] has been preserved in its natural state by the [[National Park Service]] and is frequented by fly fishers annually.

Football, especially collegiate football, has always been important to Arkansans. College football in Arkansas began from humble beginnings. The [[University of Arkansas]] first fielded a team in [[1894 Arkansas Cardinals football team|1894]] when football was a very dangerous game. [[Calling the Hogs]] is a cheer that shows support for the [[Arkansas Razorbacks|Razorbacks]], one of the two FBS teams in the state. High school football also began to grow in Arkansas in the early 20th century. Over the years, many Arkansans have looked to the Razorbacks football team as the public image of the state. Following the [[Little Rock Nine]] integration crisis at [[Little Rock Central High School]], Arkansans looked to the successful Razorback teams in the following years to repair the state's reputation. Although the University of Arkansas is based in [[Fayetteville, Arkansas|Fayetteville]], the Razorbacks have always played at least two games per season at [[War Memorial Stadium (Arkansas)|War Memorial Stadium]] in [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]] in an effort to keep fan support in central and south Arkansas. [[Arkansas State University]] joined the University of Arkansas in the Football Bowl Subdivision in 1992 after playing in lower divisions for nearly two decades. However, the two schools have never played each other, due to the University of Arkansas' policy of not playing intrastate games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Arkansas matchup is not likely soon |publisher= [[Sun Herald]] |date= July 20, 2003 |page= 9B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Six of Arkansas' smaller colleges play in the [[Great American Conference]], with [[University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff]] playing in the [[Southwestern Athletic Conference]] and [[University of Central Arkansas]] competing in the [[Southland Conference]].

Baseball runs deep in Arkansas and has been popular since before the state hosted [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) [[spring training]] in [[Hot Springs, Arkansas|Hot Springs]] from 1886-1920s. Today, two [[Minor League Baseball|minor league]] teams are based in the state. The [[Arkansas Travelers]] play at [[Dickey-Stephens Park]] in [[North Little Rock, Arkansas|North Little Rock]], and the [[Northwest Arkansas Naturals]] play in [[Arvest Ballpark]] in [[Springdale, Arkansas|Springdale]]. Both teams compete in the [[Texas League]].

Healthcare in Arkansas is provided by a network of hospitals as members of the Arkansas Hospital Association. Major institutions with multiple branches include Baptist Health, [[Community Health Systems]], and [[HealthSouth]].

Transportation in Arkansas is overseen by the [[Arkansas State Highway and Transportation Department]] (AHTD), headquartered in [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]]. Several main corridors pass through Little Rock, including [[Interstate 30 in Arkansas|Interstate&amp;nbsp;30]] (I-30) and [[Interstate 40 in Arkansas|I-40]] (the nationâ€™s 3rd-busiest trucking corridor).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Memphis: The Number One City of Chemical Related Incidents in Tennessee

Arkansas also benefits from the use of its rivers for commerce. The [[Mississippi River]] and [[Arkansas River]] are both major rivers. The [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] maintains the [[McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System]], allowing barge traffic up the Arkansas River to the [[Port of Catoosa]] in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]].

There are four airports with commercial service: [[Little Rock National Airport]], [[Northwest Arkansas Regional Airport]], [[Fort Smith Regional Airport]], and [[Texarkana Regional Airport]], with [[List of airports in Arkansas|dozens of smaller airports in the state]].

Public transit and community transport services for the elderly or those with developmental disabilities are provided by agencies such as the [[Central Arkansas Transit Authority]] and the [[Ozark Regional Transit]], organizations that are part of the [[Arkansas Transit Association]].

==Law and government==
{{Main|Politics and government of Arkansas}}
As with the federal government of the United States, political power in Arkansas is divided into three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial. Each officer's term is four years long. Office holders are [[term-limited]] to two full terms plus any partial terms before the first full term.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web |last1= English |first1= Art |last2= Weberg |first2= Brian |title= Term Limits in the Arkansas General Assembly: A Citizen Legislature Responds |year= 2005 |publisher= National Conference of State Legislatures |work= Joint Project on Term Limits |page= 1 |url= http://www.ncsl.org/Portals/1/documents/jptl/casestudies/Arkansasv2.pdf |format =  PDF |accessdate= February 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Executive===
[[File:Governor Mike Beebe 2.jpg|right|thumb|Governor [[Mike Beebe]]]]
{{Main|Governor of Arkansas}}
{{See also|List of Governors of Arkansas}}
The current Governor of Arkansas is [[Mike Beebe]], a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], who was elected on November 7, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.stateline.org/weekly/Stateline.org-Weekly-Original-Content-2006-11-06.pdf |title=Winners in '06 Governors races |format = PDF |accessdate=July 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dwe.arkansas.gov/GenIfo/administration.html |title=Arkansas.gov Administration page for Governor |publisher=Dwe.arkansas.gov |date=March 16, 2007 |accessdate=July 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beebe was reelected to his second and final term in 2010 which will expire January 13, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=  Governor Terms and Term Limits |url= http://www.snellingcenter.org/filemanager/filedownload/phpcyBOdV/Governor%20Terms%20and%20Term%20Limits.pdf |publisher= Snelling Center for Government |accessdate= January 6, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The six other elected executive positions in Arkansas are [[Lieutenant Governor of Arkansas|lieutenant governor]], [[Secretary of State of Arkansas|secretary of state]], [[Arkansas Attorney General|attorney general]], [[Arkansas State Treasurer|treasurer]], [[Arkansas State Auditor|auditor]], and land commissioner.&lt;ref&gt;Arkansas Code 7 May 806.&lt;/ref&gt; The governor also appoints qualified individuals to lead various state boards, committees, and departments. Arkansas governors served two-year terms until a referendum lengthened the term to four years, effective with the 1986 general election.

In Arkansas, the lieutenant governor is elected separately from the governor and thus can be from a different political party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Office of Lieutenant Governor |url= http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=5722 |date= February 28, 2011 |publisher= The Pryor Center |work= Encyclopedia of Arkansas History and Culture |accessdate= January 6, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legislative===
{{Main|Arkansas General Assembly}}
The [[Arkansas General Assembly]] is the state's [[bicameral]] bodies of legislators, composed of the [[Arkansas Senate|Senate]] and [[Arkansas House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. The Senate contains 35 members from districts of approximately equal population. These districts are redrawn decennially with each US census, and in election years ending in &quot;2&quot;, the entire body is put up for reelection. Following the election, half of the seats are designated as two-year seats and will be up for reelection again in two years, these &quot;half-terms&quot; do not count against a legislator's term limits. The remaining half serve a full four-year term. This staggers elections such that half the body is up for re-election every two years and allows for complete body turnover following redistricting.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web |last= Greenberg |first= Dan |url= http://arkansaseconomics.org/policy/050105.html |title= The Dangers of Diluting Term Limits |publisher= Arkansas Policy Center |accessdate= February 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Arkansas voters selected a 21-14 Republican majority in the Senate in 2012. Arkansas House members can serve a maximum of three two-year terms. House districts are redistricted by the Arkansas Board of Apportionment. Following the 2012 elections, Republicans gained a 51-49 majority in the House of Representatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Republicans Take Control of Arkansas House, Senate |url= http://5newsonline.com/2012/11/13/republicans-take-control-of-arkansas-house-senate/ |first= Mallory |last= Cooke |publisher= [[KFSM-TV]] |accessdate= January 8, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Republican Party [[majority]] status in the Arkansas State House of Representatives following the 2012 elections is the party's first since 1874. Arkansas was the last state of the old Confederacy to never have Republicans control either chamber of its house since the Civil War.&lt;ref name=&quot;sen&quot; &gt;{{cite web |title= Arkansas Senate flips; first time since Reconstruction |date= November 7, 2012 |publisher= The Courier |url= http://www.couriernews.com/view/full_story/20738303/article-Arkansas-Senate-flips--first-time-since-Reconstruction |accessdate= January 8, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the term limits changes, studies have show that lobbyist have become less influential in state politics, but legislative staff, not subject to term limits, have acquired additional power and influence due to the high rate of elected official turnover.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web |last1= English |first1= Art |last2= Weberg |first2= Brian |title= Term Limits in the Arkansas General Assembly: A Citizen Legislature Responds |year= 2005 |publisher= National Conference of State Legislatures |work= Joint Project on Term Limits |url= http://www.ncsl.org/Portals/1/documents/jptl/casestudies/Arkansasv2.pdf |format =  PDF |pages=33â€“34 |accessdate= February 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judicial===
{{Main|Courts of Arkansas}}
Arkansas's judicial branch has five court systems: [[Arkansas Supreme Court]], [[Arkansas Court of Appeals]], Circuit Courts, District Courts and City Courts.

Most cases begin in district court, which is subdivided into state district court and local district court. State district courts exercise district-wide jurisdiction over the districts created by the General Assembly, and local district courts are presided over by part-time judges who may privately practice law. There are currently 25 state district court judges presiding over 15 districts, with more districts to be created in 2013 and 2017. There are 28 judicial circuits of Circuit Court, with each contains five subdivisions: criminal, civil, probate, domestic relations, and juvenile court. The jurisdiction of the Arkansas Court of Appeals is determined by the Arkansas Supreme Court, and there is no [[appeal|right of appeal]] from the Court of Appeals to the high court. However, the Arkansas Supreme Court can review Court of Appeals cases upon application by either a party to the litigation, upon request by the Court of Appeals, or if the Arkansas Supreme Court feels the case should have been initially assigned to it. The twelve judges of the Arkansas Court of Appeals are elected from judicial districts to renewable six-year terms.

The Arkansas Supreme Court is the court of last resort in the state, composed of seven justices elected to eight-year terms. Established by the Arkansas Constitution in 1836, the court's decisions can be appealed to only the [[Supreme Court of the United States]].

===Federal===
One of Arkansas's U.S. Senators is Democrat [[Mark Pryor]], and the other one is Republican [[John Boozman]]. The state has four seats in [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]]. All four seats are held by Republicans: [[Rick Crawford (politician)|Rick Crawford]] ([[Arkansas's 1st congressional district|1st district]]), [[Tim Griffin]] ([[Arkansas's 2nd congressional district|2nd district]]), [[Steve Womack]] ([[Arkansas's 3rd congressional district|3rd district]]), and [[Tom Cotton]] ([[Arkansas's 4th congressional district|4th district]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;sw&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title= New Arkansas Rep.

Arkansas Governor [[Bill Clinton]] brought national attention to the state with a long speech at the [[1988 Democratic National Convention]] endorsing [[Michael Dukakis]]. Pundits suggested the speech would ruin Clinton's political career, but instead, Clinton won the Democratic nomination for President the following cycle. Presenting himself as a &quot;New Democrat&quot; and using incumbent [[George H. W. Bush]]'s [[Read my lips: no new taxes|broken promise]] against him, Clinton won the [[U.S. presidential election, 1992|1992 presidential election]] (43.0% of the vote) against Republican Bush (37.4% of the vote) and billionaire [[populism|populist]] [[Ross Perot]], who ran as an independent (18.9% of the vote).

Most Republican strength lies mainly in the northwestern part of the state, particularly [[Fort Smith, Arkansas|Fort Smith]] and [[Bentonville, Arkansas|Bentonville]], as well as North Central Arkansas around the [[Mountain Home, Arkansas|Mountain Home]] area. In the latter area, Republicans have been known to get 90 percent or more of the vote. The rest of the state is more Democratic. Arkansas has only elected two Republicans to the U.S. Senate since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], [[Tim Hutchinson]], who was defeated after one term by [[Mark Pryor]] and [[John Boozman]], who defeated incumbent [[Blanche Lincoln]]. Prior to 2013, the General Assembly had not been controlled by the Republican Party since Reconstruction with the GOP holding a 51-seat majority in the state House and a 21-seat (of 35) in the state Senate following victories in 2012. Arkansas was one of just three states among the states of the former [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] that sent two Democrats to the U.S. Senate (the others being Florida and [[Virginia]]) during the first decade of the 21st century.

In 2010, Republicans captured three of the state's four seats in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]]. In 2012, Republicans won election for all four House seats. Arkansas holds the distinction of having a U.S. House delegation composed of military veterans ([[Rick Crawford (politician)|Rick Crawford]] - [[Army]]; [[Tim Griffin]] - [[United States Army Reserve|Army Reserve]]; [[Steve Womack]] - Army [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]], [[Tom Cotton]]- Army).

Reflecting the state's large evangelical population, the state has a strong social conservative bent. Under the [[Arkansas Constitution]] Arkansas is a [[right to work state]], its voters passed a ban on [[same-sex marriage]] with 75% voting yes, and the state is one of a handful with legislation on its books banning abortion in the event ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' is ever overturned.
