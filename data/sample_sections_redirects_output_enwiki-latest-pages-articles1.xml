		The '''economy of Afghanistan''' has improved significantly since 2002 due to the infusion of billions of dollars in international assistance and investments,&lt;ref name=&quot;PAN6&quot;&gt;[http://www.pajhwok.com/en/2010/06/09/central-bank-claims-hike-cash-reserves Central bank claims hike in cash reserves], [[Pajhwok Afghan News]] (PAN). 2010-06-09.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as remittances from [[Afghan diaspora|Afghan expats]].&lt;ref name=PAN5&gt;{{cite news |publisher=Pajhwok Afghan News (PAN) |url=http://www.pajhwok.com/en/2007/10/19/afghanistan-receives-33b-remittances-expats |title=Afghanistan receives $3.3b remittances from expats |date=October 19, 2007 |accessdate=2012-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recent improvement is also due to dramatic improvements in agricultural production and the end of a four-year drought&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/oct/14/world/fg-drought14|publisher=[[Los Angelos Times]]|accessdate=2013-08-14|title=Drought in Afghanistan Killing Off Cattle, Sheep}}&lt;/ref&gt; in most of the country.

		<section1>Economic history</section1>
	Historically, there has been a lack of information and reliable statistics about Afghanistan's economy. In the early modern period under the rule of kings [[Abdur Rahman Khan]] (1880–1901) and [[Habibullah Khan]] (1901–1919), a great deal of Afghan commerce was centrally controlled by the Afghan government. The Afghan monarchs were eager to develop the stature of government and the country's military capability, and so attempted to raise money by the imposition of state monopolies on the sale of commodoties and high taxes. This slowed the long-term development of Afghanistan during that period. Western techonogies and manufacturing methods were slowly introduced during these eras at the command of the Afghan ruler, but in general only according to the logistical requirements of the growing army. An emphasis was placed on the manufacture of weapons and other military materiel. This process was in the hands of a small number of western experts invited to Kabul by the Afghan kings. Otherwise, it was not possible for outsiders, particularly westerners, to set up large-scale enterprises in Afghanistan during that period.&lt;ref&gt;Asian Affairs Journal, [http://www.bijanomrani.com/?p=Making_money_%20in_%20Afghanistan Making Money in Afghanistan: The First Western Entrepreneurs 1880-1919], Vol 3, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

	The first prominent plan to develop Afghanistan's economy in modern times was the [[Helmand and Arghandab Valley Authority|Helmand Valley Authority]] project, modelled on the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] in the [[United States]], which was expected to be of primary economic importance.&lt;ref name=tudor&gt;[http://184.73.243.18:8080/xmlui/handle/123456789/1803?show=full Report on Development of Helmand Valley, Afghanistan, 1956], Tudor Engineering Company&lt;/ref&gt; The country began facing severe economic hardships during the 1970s when neighboring Pakistan, under [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]], began closing the Pakistan-Afghanistan [[border crossing]]s. This move resulted in Afghanistan increasing political and economic ties with its northern neighbor, the powerful [[Soviet Union]] of that time.

	The 1979 [[Soviet war in Afghanistan|Soviet invasion]] and ensuing [[War in Afghanistan (1978–present)|civil war]] destroyed much of the country's limited infrastructure, and disrupted normal patterns of economic activity (See ''[[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan#Economy]]''). Eventually, Afghanistan went from a [[traditional economy]] to a centrally [[planned economy]] up until 2002 when it was replaced by a free market economy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unodc.org/pdf/publications/afg_opium_economy_www.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; Gross domestic product has fallen substantially since the 1980s due to disruption of trade and transport as well as loss of labor and capital. Continuing internal strife severely hampered domestic efforts to rebuild the nation or provide ways for the international community to help.

	According to the [[International Monetary Fund]], the Afghan economy grew 20% in the [[fiscal year]] ending in March 2004, after expanding 30% in the previous 12 months. The growth is attributed to international aid and to the end of [[drought]]s. An estimated $4.4 billion of aid entered the nation from 2002 to 2004. A GDP of $4 billion in fiscal year 2003 was recalculated by the IMF to $6.1 billion, after adding proceeds from [[opium]] products. Mean graduate pay was $0.56 per manhour in 2010.

		The Afghan economy has always been agricultural, despite the fact that only 12% of its total land is arable and about 6% is currently cultivated. [[Agriculture]] production is constrained by an almost total dependence on erratic winter snows and spring rains for water. As of 2007, the country's [[fruit]] and [[Nut (fruit)|nut]] exports were at $113 million per year, but according to an estimate could grow to more than $800 million per year in 10 years given sufficient investment. Afghanistan is known for producing some of the finest fruits, vegetables, turtles, and especially [[pomegranate]]s, [[apricot]]s, [[grape]]s, [[melon]]s, and [[mulberries]]. Several provinces in the north of the country (i.e. [[Badghis Province|Badghis]] and [[Samangan Province|Samangan]]) are famous for [[pistachio]] cultivation but the area currently lacks proper marketing and processing plants. It is claimed that some Indian companies buy Afghan pistachios for a very low price, process them in [[India]] and sell to western countries as Indian products. However, the Afghan government is planning to build storage facilities for pistachios since receiving bumper crops in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pajhwok.com/en/2010/08/07/bumper-pistachio-crops-year-samangan |title=Bumper pistachio crops this year in Samangan |publisher=Pajhwok Afghan News (PAN) |date=August 7, 2010 |accessdate=2012-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bamyan Province]] in central Afghanistan is known for growing superior [[potato]]es, which on an average produces 140,000 to 170,000 tonnes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.pajhwok.com/en/2012/07/30/bamyan-farmers-eyeing-bumper-potato-yield |title=Bamyan farmers eyeing bumper potato yield |date=July 30, 2012 |accessdate=2012-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

		[[Wheat]] and [[cereal]] production is Afghanistan's traditional agricultural mainstay. National wheat production in 2010 was 4,532 MT.&lt;ref&gt;eAfghanAg, [http://eafghanag.ucdavis.edu/b_field-crops/wheat-1/wheat], April 13, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The overall agricultural production dramatically declined following four years of drought as well as the sustained fighting and instability in rural areas. Soviet efforts to disrupt production in resistance-dominated areas also contributed to this decline. Furthermore, since 2002 more than 4 million refugees returned to Afghanistan. Many of these former refugees are now involved in the farming industry. Some studies indicate that agricultural production and livestock numbers may only be sufficient to feed about half of the country's population. Shortages are exacerbated by the country's limited transportation network, which is currently being rebuilt. A report by the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) states that Afghanistan was nearing self-sufficiency in grain production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=Pajhwok Afghan News (PAN) |url=http://www.pajhwok.com/en/2007/08/22/wheat-production-hits-record-high-takhar |title=Wheat production hits record high in Takhar |date=August 22, 2007 |accessdate=2012-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

		Trade in goods smuggled into Pakistan once constituted a major source of revenue for Afghanistan. Many of the goods that were smuggled into Pakistan have originally entered Afghanistan from Pakistan, where they fell under the ''Afghan Trade and Transit Agreement'' (ATTA). This permitted goods bound for Afghanistan to transit through Pakistan free of [[duty (economics)|duty]]. This resulted in considerable problems for the Pakistani government, particularly its customs bureau who realized that many of the items being resold on the [[black market]] in Pakistan were the very same items being allowed duty-free exemption from Pakistani ports (mainly [[Karachi]]) on their way to Afghanistan. When Pakistan clamped down in 2003 on the types of goods permitted duty-free transit, and introducing stringent measures and labels to prevent such practices, re-routing of goods through Iran from the [[Persian Gulf]] increased significantly. The pre-2003 smuggling trade provided undocumented jobs to tens of thousands of Afghans and Pakistanis, but also helped fuel the ''black'' economy, often intertwined with the drug cartels, of both countries. Afghanistan and Pakistan recently signed into law a new ''Afghan-Pak Trade and Transit Agreement'' (APTTA), which allows their shipping [[truck]]s to transit goods within both nations. This revised US-sponsored APTTA agreement also allows Afghan trucks to transport exports to India via Pakistan through the [[Wagah]] crossing point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.pajhwok.com/en/2010/11/29/afghan-pakistan-chamber-commerce-set |title=Afghan-Pakistan chamber of commerce set up |first=Abdul Qadir |last=Siddiqui |publisher=Pajhwok Afghan News |date=November 29, 2010|accessdate=2010-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.pajhwok.com/en/2010/12/05/pakistan-resolve-afghan-traders-problems|title=Pakistan to resolve Afghan traders' problems |first=Abdul Qadir |last=Siddiqui |publisher=Pajhwok Afghan News |date=December 5, 2010|accessdate=2010-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Afghanistan's Chamber of Commerce and Industries deputy head, Khan Jan Alokozai, about 500 [[intermodal container|shipping container]]s of trade goods enter Afghanistan via the [[Torkham]] and [[Wesh-Chaman border crossing]]s on a daily basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.pajhwok.com/en/2011/02/16/pakistan-waives-tax-afghan-trucks |title=Pakistan waives off tax on Afghan trucks |first=Abdul Qadir |last=Siddiqui |publisher=Pajhwok Afghan News (PAN)|date=February 16, 2011|accessdate=2010-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other major trade routes in Afghanistan are via the crossing borders in [[Zaranj]], [[Islam Qala]], [[Hairatan]], [[Shir Khan Bandar]], and [[Towraghondi]].

		Afghanistan embarked on a modest economic development program in the 1930s. The government founded banks; introduced paper money; established a university; expanded primary, secondary, and technical schools; and sent students abroad for education. In 1952 it created the [[Helmand and Arghandab Valley Authority|Helmand Valley Authority]] to manage the economic development of the Helmand and Arghandab valleys through irrigation and land development,&lt;ref name=&quot;tudor&quot;/&gt; a scheme which remains one of the country's most important capital resources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10106049809354643 Remote sensing change detection of irrigated agriculture in Afghanistan], Barry Haacka, James Wolfb &amp; Richard Englishb; Geocarto International; Volume 13, Issue 2, 1998; pages 65-75; DOI: 10.1080/10106049809354643&lt;/ref&gt;

		In 1956, the government promulgated the first in a long series of ambitious development plans. By the late 1970s, these had achieved only mixed results due to flaws in the planning process as well as inadequate funding and a shortage of the skilled managers and technicians needed for implementation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.strategicoutlook.org/asia---pasific/news-socio-economic-overview-of-afghanistan.html], Socio-Economic Overview of Afghanistan, Strategic Outlook&lt;/ref&gt;

		[[Da Afghanistan Bank]] serves as the central bank of the nation and the [[Afghan afghani|&quot;Afghani&quot;]] (AFN) is the national currency, with an exchange rate of about 53 Afghanis to [[United States dollar|1 US dollar]]. There are over 16 different banks operating in the country, including [[Afghanistan International Bank]], [[Kabul Bank]], [[Azizi Bank]], [[Pashtany Bank]], [[Standard Chartered Bank]], [[First Micro Finance Bank]], and others. A new law on private investment provides three to seven-year [[tax holiday]]s to eligible companies and a four-year exemption from exports [[tariff]]s and duties. According to a UN report in 2007, Afghanistan has received over $3.3 billion from its expatriate community in 2006. UN officials familiar with the issue said remittances to Afghanistan could have been more if the banking regulations are more convenient.&lt;ref name=PAN5/&gt; Additionally, improvements to the business-enabling environment have resulted in more than $1.5 billion in [[Telecommunication|telecom]] investment and created more than 100,000 jobs since 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://afghanistan.usaid.gov/en/programs/economic_growth#Tab=Description |title=Economic Growth |publisher=USAID|accessdate=25 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
