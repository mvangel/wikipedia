Slovakia is bordered by the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Austria]] to the west, [[Poland]] to the north, [[Ukraine]] to the east and [[Hungary]] to the south. The largest city is the capital, [[Bratislava]], and the second largest is [[Košice]]. Slovakia is a member state of the [[European Union]], Eurozone, [[Schengen Area]], [[NATO]], the [[United Nations]], the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] and the [[World Trade Organization|WTO]], among others. The [[official language]] is [[Slovak language|Slovak]], a member of the [[Slavic languages|Slavic language family]].

The [[Slavs]]—ancestors of the Slovaks—arrived in the territory of present-day Slovakia in the 5th and 6th centuries during the [[migration period]]. In the 7th century, Slavs inhabiting this territory played a significant role in the creation of [[Samo]]'s Empire, historically the first Slavic state which had its center in Western Slovakia. During the 9th century, Slavic ancestors of the Slovaks established another political entity, the [[Principality of Nitra]], which later together with the Principality of Moravia, formed [[Great Moravia]]. After the 10th century the territory of today's Slovakia was gradually integrated into the [[Kingdom of Hungary]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Russian &amp; Slavic myth and legend|last=Dixon-Kennedy|first=Mike|year=1998|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-57607-130-4|page=375|url=http://books.google.com/?id=eD5AkdM83iIC&amp;pg=PA57&amp;dq=slovakia+was+part+of++hungary|accessdate=23 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; which itself became part of the [[Austria–Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]] or Habsburg Empire. After WWI and the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the nation of Slovaks and Czechs established their mutual state - [[Czechoslovakia]]. A separate [[Slovak Republic (1939–1945)|Slovak state]] existed during [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]] and was a [[client state]] of [[Nazi Germany]] (from 1939 to 1944). In 1945 Czechoslovakia was reestablished. The present-day Slovakia became an independent state on 1 January 1993 after the peaceful [[dissolution of Czechoslovakia]].

==History==
{{Main|History of Slovakia}}

[[File:Moravianska venusa.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A [[Moravany Venus|Venus]] from [[Moravany nad Váhom]], which dates back to 22,800 BC.]]
[[Radiocarbon dating]] puts the oldest surviving archaeological artifacts from Slovakia – found near [[Nové Mesto nad Váhom]] – at 270,000&amp;nbsp;BC, in the [[Lower Paleolithic|Early Paleolithic]] era. These ancient tools, made by the [[Clactonian|Clactonian technique]], bear witness to the ancient habitation of Slovakia.

Other [[stone tool]]s from the [[Middle Paleolithic|Middle Paleolithic era]] (200,000 – 80,000&amp;nbsp;BC) come from the Prévôt (Prepoštská) cave near [[Bojnice]] and from other nearby sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://muzeumpraveku.sk/ |title=Museum of Prehistoric |first=|last=Museum of Prehistoric Prepoštská Cave|work=muzeumpraveku.sk |year=2011 |accessdate=25 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most important discovery from that era is a [[Neanderthal]] [[human skull|cranium]] (c. 200,000 BC), discovered near [[Gánovce]], a village in northern Slovakia.

Archaeologists have found prehistoric human skeletons in the region, as well as numerous objects and vestiges of the [[Gravettian]] culture, principally in the river valleys of [[Nitra (river)|Nitra]], [[Hron]], [[Ipeľ]], [[Váh]] and as far as the city of [[Žilina]], and near the foot of the [[Vihorlat Mountains|Vihorlat]], Inovec, and [[Tribeč]] mountains, as well as in the [[Myjava]] Mountains. The most well-known finds include the oldest female statue made of [[mammoth]]-bone (22,800&amp;nbsp;BC), the famous [[Venus of Moravany]]. The statue was found in the 1940s in [[Moravany nad Váhom]] near [[Piešťany]]. Numerous necklaces made of shells from Cypraca thermophile [[gastropoda|gastropods]] of the [[Tertiary|Tertiary period]] have come from the sites of Zákovská, Podkovice, Hubina, and Radošinare. These findings provide the most ancient evidence of commercial exchanges carried out between the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and Central Europe.

===Bronze age===
[[File:Web Biatec.jpg|thumb|Left: A [[Celts|Celtic]] [[Biatec]] coin&lt;br/&gt;Right: Five [[Slovak koruna|Slovak crowns]]]]
The [[Bronze Age]] in Slovakia went through three stages of development, stretching from 2000 to 800&amp;nbsp;BC. &lt;!--I am not sure what the following sentences mean, so I put them into this comment: To this there period belongs the well-known funeral culture of the Carpathians and that of the middle [[Danube]]. During the later Neolithic Age a considerable growth in cultural regions took place in Slovakia.--&gt; Major cultural, economic, and political development can be attributed to the significant growth in production of copper, especially in central Slovakia (for example in [[Špania Dolina]]) and northwest Slovakia. Copper became a stable source of prosperity for the local population.

After the disappearance of the Čakany and [[Velatice]] cultures, the [[Lusatian culture|Lusatian]] people expanded building of strong and complex fortifications, with the large permanent buildings and administrative centers. Excavations of Lusatian [[hill fort]]s document the substantial development of trade and agriculture at that period. The richness and the diversity of tombs increased considerably. The inhabitants of the area manufactured arms, shields, jewelry, dishes, and statues.

===Iron age===

====Hallstatt Period====
The arrival of tribes from [[Thrace]] disrupted the people of the [[Kalenderberg culture]], who lived in the hamlets located on the plain ([[Sereď]]) and in the hill forts like Molpír, near [[Smolenice]], in the [[Little Carpathians]]. During Hallstatt times, monumental burial mounds were erected in western Slovakia, with princely equipment consisting of richly decorated vessels, ornaments and decorations. The burial rites consisted entirely of cremation. The common people were buried in flat urnfield cemeteries. A special role was given to weaving and the production of textiles. The local power of the &quot;Princes&quot; of the [[Hallstatt culture|Hallstatt period]] disappeared in Slovakia during the last century before the middle of first millennium BCE, after strife between the [[Scythians|Scytho]]-Thracian people and locals, resulting in abandonment of the old hill-forts. Relatively depopulated areas soon caught interest of emerging [[Celts|Celtic]] tribes, who advanced from the south towards the north, following the Slovak rivers, peacefully integrating into the remnants of the local population.

====La Tène Period====
From around 500&amp;nbsp;BC, the territory of modern-day Slovakia was settled by [[Celt]]s, who built powerful [[Enclosed oppidum|oppida]] on the sites of modern-day [[Bratislava]] and [[Devín|Devin]].  [[Biatec]]s, [[silver coin]]s with inscriptions in the Latin alphabet, represent the first known use of writing in Slovakia. At the northern regions, remnants of the local population of Lusatian origin, together with Celtic and later Dacian influence, gave rise to the unique [[Puchov culture]], with advanced crafts and iron-working, many hill-forts and fortified settlements of central type with coinage of the &quot;Velkobysterecky&quot; type (no inscriptions, with a horse on one side and a head on the other). This culture is often connected with the Celtic tribe mentioned in Roman sources as [[Cotini]].

====Roman Period====
From 2&amp;nbsp;[[Anno Domini|AD]], the expanding [[Roman Empire]] established and maintained a series of outposts around and just north of the [[Danube]], the largest of which were known as [[Carnuntum]] (whose remains are on the main road halfway between Vienna and Bratislava) and Brigetio (present-day [[Szöny]] at the Slovak-Hungarian border). Such Roman border settlements were built on the present area of Rusovce, currently a suburb of Bratislava. The military fort was surrounded by a civilian vicus and several farms of the villa rustica type. The name of this settlement was [[Gerulata]]. The military fort had an auxiliary cavalry unit, approximately 300 horses strong, modeled after the [[Cananefates]]. The remains of Roman buildings have also survived in Devin castle (present-day downtown Bratislava), the suburbs of Dubravka and Stupava, and Bratislava Castle Hill.

[[File:Trencin-Roman2.JPG|thumb|A Roman inscription at the castle hill of [[Trenčín]] (178–179 AD).]]
Near the northernmost line of the Roman hinterlands, the [[Limes|Limes Romanus]], there existed the winter camp of [[Trenčín|Laugaricio]] (modern-day [[Trenčín]]) where the Auxiliary of Legion&amp;nbsp;II fought and prevailed in a decisive battle over the Germanic [[Quadi]] tribe in 179&amp;nbsp;AD during the [[Marcomannic Wars]]. The Kingdom of [[Vannius]], a kingdom founded by the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Suebi]]an tribes of [[Quadi]] and [[Marcomanni]], as well as several small Germanic and [[List of Celtic tribes|Celtic tribes]], including the Osi and [[Cotini]], existed in Western and Central Slovakia from 8–6&amp;nbsp;BC to 179&amp;nbsp;AD.

===Great invasions from the 4th to 7th centuries===
In the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD, the [[Huns]] began to leave the Central Asian steppes. They crossed the Danube in 377&amp;nbsp;AD and occupied [[Pannonia]], which they used for 75&amp;nbsp;years as their base for launching looting-raids into Western Europe. However, Attila's death in 453 brought about the disappearance of the Hun tribe. In 568, a Turko-Mongol tribal confederacy, the [[European Avars|Avars]], conducted its own invasion into the Middle Danube region. The Avars occupied the lowlands of the [[Pannonian Plain]], and established an empire dominating the [[Pannonian Basin|Carpathian Basin]].

In 623, the Slavic population living in the western parts of Pannonia seceded from their empire after a revolution led by Samo, a Frankish merchant.&lt;ref name='Történeti Kronológia'&gt;{{cite book|last=Benda|first=Kálmán|title=Magyarország történeti kronológiája ''(&quot;The Historical Chronology of Hungary&quot;)''|publisher=Akadémiai Kiadó|year=1981|location=Budapest|page=44|isbn=963-05-2661-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 626, the Avar power started a gradual decline&lt;ref&gt;Kristó, p.30–31&lt;/ref&gt; but its reign lasted to 804.

===Slavic states===
The [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] tribes settled in the territory of present-day Slovakia in the 5th century. Western Slovakia was the centre of [[Samo|Samo's empire]] in the 7th century. A Slavic state known as the [[Principality of Nitra]] arose in the 8th century and its ruler [[Pribina]] had the first known Christian church of Slovakia consecrated by 828. Together with neighboring [[Moravia]], the principality formed the core of the [[Great Moravia|Great Moravian Empire]] from 833. The high point of this Slavonic empire came with the arrival of [[Saints Cyril and Methodius]] in 863, during the reign of Prince [[Rastislav]], and the territorial expansion under King [[Svatopluk I]].

===Great Moravia (830–before 907)===
{{Main|Great Moravia}}

[[File:Cyril a metod zilina.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A statue of [[Saints Cyril and Methodius|Saint Cyril and Saint Methodius]] in [[Žilina]]. In 863, they introduced Christianity to what is now Slovakia.]]

Great Moravia arose around 830 when Mojmír I unified the Slavic tribes settled north of the [[Danube]] and extended the Moravian supremacy over them.&lt;ref&gt;'Europe', p.360&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Mojmír&amp;nbsp;I]] endeavoured to secede from the supremacy of the king of [[East Francia]] in 846, King [[Louis the German]] deposed him and assisted Moimír's nephew [[Rastislav]] (846–870) in acquiring the throne.&lt;ref name='Korai Magyar Történeti Lexikon'&gt;{{cite book|last=Kristó|first=Gyula|title=Korai Magyar Történeti Lexikon (9–14. század) ''(Encyclopedia of the Early Hungarian History – 9th–14th centuries)''|publisher=Akadémiai Kiadó|year=1994|location=Budapest|page=467|isbn=963-05-6722-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new monarch pursued an independent policy: after stopping a Frankish attack in 855, he also sought to weaken influence of Frankish priests preaching in his realm. Rastislav asked the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine Emperor]] [[Michael III]] to send teachers who would interpret Christianity in the Slavic vernacular.

Upon Rastislav's request, two brothers, Byzantine officials and missionaries [[Saints Cyril and Methodius]] came in 863.

In 880, [[Pope John&amp;nbsp;VIII]] set up an independent [[ecclesiastical province]] in Great Moravia with Archbishop [[Saints Cyril and Methodius|Methodius]] as its head. He also named the German cleric [[Wiching]] the Bishop of [[Nitra]].

After the death of Prince Svatopluk in 894, his sons [[Mojmír&amp;nbsp;II]] (894–906?) and [[Svatopluk&amp;nbsp;II]] succeeded him as the Prince of Great Moravia and the Prince of Nitra respectively.&lt;ref name='caplovic'/&gt; However, they started to quarrel for domination of the whole empire.

We do not know what happened with both Mojmír&amp;nbsp;II and Svatopluk&amp;nbsp;II because they are not mentioned in written sources after 906. In [[Battle of Pressburg|three battles]] (4–5 July and 9 August 907) near [[Bratislava]], the Magyars routed [[Bavaria]]n armies. Some historians put this year as the date of the breakup of the Great Moravian Empire, due to the Hungarian conquest; other historians take the date a little bit earlier (to 902).

Great Moravia left behind a lasting legacy in Central and Eastern Europe. The [[Glagolitic alphabet|Glagolitic script]] and its successor [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] were disseminated to other Slavic countries, charting a new path in their [[Sociocultural evolution|sociocultural development]].

Following the disintegration of the Great Moravian Empire at the turn of the 10th century, the Hungarians annexed the territory comprising modern Slovakia. From the 11th century, when the territory inhabited by the Slavic-speaking population of Danubian Basin was incorporated into the Kingdom of Hungary, until 1918, when the [[Austro-Hungarian empire]] collapsed, the territory of modern Slovakia was an integral part of the Hungarian state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=sOlD_8Kw0K0C&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=slovak+territory+part+of+hungary+11+century&amp;hl=sk&amp;ei=lD54TqDdB430-gbE9eGbDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CFUQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=slovak%20territory%20part%20of%20hungary%2011%20century&amp;f=false |title=James Ramon Felak. p 3. 1994 |publisher=Books.google.com |accessdate=2013-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Brjcd07bN6sC&amp;pg=PA71&amp;dq=slovak+territory+part+of+hungary+11+century&amp;hl=sk&amp;ei=lD54TqDdB430-gbE9eGbDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Rudolf Schuster, M.

A significant decline in the population resulted from the [[Mongol invasion of Europe|invasion of the Mongols]] in 1241 and the subsequent famine.

Before the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s expansion into Hungary and the occupation of [[Buda]] in 1541, the capital of the Kingdom of Hungary (under the name of [[Royal Hungary]]) moved to Pressburg (in {{lang-sk|Prešporok}} at that time, currently Bratislava). Pressburg became the capital city of the Royal Hungary in 1536. But the [[Ottoman wars in Europe|Ottoman wars]] and frequent insurrections against the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] also inflicted a great deal of devastation, especially in the rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.slovakiasite.com/history-hungary.php Part of Hungary, Turkish occupation]&quot;.

===Czechoslovakia (1918–1939)===

[[File:Masaryk a Štefánik.jpg|thumb|150px|left|A monument to [[Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk]] and [[Milan Rastislav Štefánik|Milan Štefánik]] - both key figures in early Czechoslovakia]]
In 1918, Slovakia and the regions of [[Bohemia]], [[Moravia]], [[Czech Silesia|Silesia]] and [[Carpathian Ruthenia]] formed a common state, [[Czechoslovakia]], with the borders confirmed by the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint Germain]] and [[Treaty of Trianon]]. In 1919, during the chaos following the breakup of Austria-Hungary, Czechoslovakia was formed with numerous Germans and Hungarians within the newly set borders. A Slovak patriot [[Milan Rastislav Štefánik]] (1880–1919), who helped organize Czechoslovak regiments against Austria-Hungary during the First World War, died in a plane crash. In the peace following the World War, Czechoslovakia emerged as a sovereign European state. It provided what were at the time rather extensive rights to its minorities and remained the only democracy in this part of Europe in the interwar period.

During the [[Interwar period]], democratic Czechoslovakia was allied with France, and also with [[Romania]] and [[Yugoslavia]] ([[Little Entente]]); however, the [[Locarno Treaties]] of 1925 left East European security open. Both Czechs and Slovaks enjoyed a period of relative prosperity.  There was progress in not only the development of the country's economy, but also culture and educational opportunities. The minority Germans came to accept their role in the new country and relations with Austria were good. Yet the [[Great Depression]] caused a sharp economic downturn, followed by political disruption and insecurity in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;J.&amp;nbsp;V.&amp;nbsp;Polisencky, ''History of Czechoslovakia in Outline'' (Prague: Bohemia International 1947) at 113–114.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thereafter Czechoslovakia came under continuous pressure from the [[Revanchism|revisionist]] governments of Germany and Hungary. Eventually this led to the [[Munich Agreement]] of September 1938, which allowed Nazi Germany to partially dismember the country by occupying what was called the [[Sudetenland]], a region with a German-speaking majority and bordering Germany and Austria. The remainder of &quot;rump&quot; Czechoslovakia was renamed [[Czecho-Slovakia]] and included a greater degree of Slovak political autonomy. Southern and eastern Slovakia, however, was reclaimed by Hungary at the [[First Vienna Award]] of November 1938.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

After the Munich Agreement and its [[Vienna Awards|Vienna Award]], [[Nazi Germany]] threatened to annex part of Slovakia and allow the remaining regions to be partitioned by Hungary or Poland unless independence was declared. Thus, Slovakia seceded from Czecho-Slovakia in March 1939 and allied itself, as demanded by Germany, with [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler's]] coalition.&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard L. Weinberg, ''The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany: Starting World War II, 1937–1939'' (Chicago, 1980), pp. 470–481.&lt;/ref&gt; The government of the [[Slovak Republic (1939–1945)|First Slovak Republic]], led by [[Jozef Tiso]] and [[Vojtech Tuka]], was strongly influenced by Germany and gradually became a [[puppet state|puppet regime]] in many respects.
[[File:Jozef Tiso (Berlin).jpg|thumb|left|President of the [[First Slovak Republic]], [[Jozef Tiso]] with [[Adolf Hitler]], 1941.]]
Most Jews were deported from the country and taken to German [[death camps]]. Thousands of Jews, however, remained to labor in Slovak work camps in Sereď, Vyhne, and Nováky.&lt;ref&gt;Leni Yahil, ''The Holocaust: The Fate of European Jewry, 1932–1945'' (Oxford, 1990), pp. 402–403.&lt;/ref&gt; Tiso, through the granting of presidential exceptions, has been credited with saving as many as 40,000 Jews during the war, although other estimates place the figure closer to 4,000 or even 1,000.&lt;ref&gt;For the higher figure, see Milan S. Ďurica, ''The Slovak Involvement in the Tragedy of the European Jews'' (Abano Terme: Piovan Editore, 1989), p. 12; for the lower figure, see Gila Fatran, &quot;The Struggle for Jewish Survival During the Holocaust&quot; in ''The Tragedy of the Jews of Slovakia'' (Banská Bystrica, 2002), p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt;
Nevertheless, under Tiso's government, the vast majority of Slovakia's Jewish population (between 75,000-105,000 individuals) were murdered.&lt;ref&gt;Dawidowicz, Lucy.

After it became clear that the Soviet [[Red Army]] was going to push the Nazis out of eastern and central Europe, an anti-Nazi [[resistance movement]] launched a fierce armed insurrection, known as the [[Slovak National Uprising]], near the end of summer 1944. A bloody German occupation and a guerilla war followed. The territory of Slovakia was liberated by Soviet and Romanian forces by the end of April 1945.

The country was [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|occupied]] by the Warsaw Pact forces (with the exception of [[Romania]]) in 1968, ending a [[Prague Spring|period of liberalization]] under the leadership of [[Alexander Dubček]].

===Establishment of the Slovak Republic (1992-)===
The end of Communist rule in Czechoslovakia in 1989, during the peaceful [[Velvet Revolution]], was followed once again by the country's dissolution, this time into two [[succession of states|successor states]]. In July 1992 Slovakia, led by Prime Minister [[Vladimír Mečiar]], declared itself a sovereign state, meaning that its laws took precedence over those of the federal government. Throughout the autumn of 1992, Mečiar and [[List of Prime Ministers of the Czech Republic|Czech Prime Minister]] [[Václav Klaus]] negotiated the details for disbanding the federation. In November the federal parliament voted to dissolve the country officially on 31 December 1992.

The Slovak Republic and the [[Czech Republic]] went their separate ways after 1 January 1993, an event sometimes called the [[Dissolution of Czechoslovakia|Velvet Divorce]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slovakia.org/history-topics |title=The Breakup of Czechoslovakia |publisher=Slovakia |accessdate=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/velvet+divorce |title=Velvet divorce |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |accessdate=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slovakia has remained a close partner with the Czech Republic. Both countries cooperate with Hungary and Poland in the [[Visegrád Group]]. Slovakia became a member of NATO on 29 March 2004 and of the European Union on 1 May 2004. On 1 January 2009, Slovakia adopted the Euro as its national currency.

{{See also|Geomorphological division of Slovakia}}
Slovakia lies between latitudes [[47th parallel north|47°]] and [[50th parallel north|50° N]], and longitudes [[16th meridian east|16°]] and [[23rd meridian east|23° E]].

The Slovak landscape is noted primarily for its mountainous nature, with the [[Carpathian Mountains]] extending across most of the northern half of the country. Amongst these [[mountain range]]s are the high peaks of the [[Fatra-Tatra Area]] (including [[Tatra mountains]], [[Greater Fatra]] and [[Lesser Fatra]]), [[Slovak Ore Mountains]], [[Slovak Central Mountains]] or [[Beskids]]. The largest lowland is the fertile [[Danubian Lowland]] in the southwest, followed by the [[Eastern Slovak Lowland]] in the southeast.&lt;ref name=cia&gt;{{cite web |title= Slovakia |work= The World Factbook |publisher= [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] |year=2007 |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/lo.html |accessdate=26 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tatra mountains===
{{Main|Tatra mountains}}
[[Tatra Mountains|Tatras]], with 29 peaks higher than {{convert|2500|m|ft|0|abbr=off}} [[AMSL]], are the highest mountain range in the Carpathian Mountains. Tatras occupy an area of {{convert|750|km²|0|abbr=out}}, of which the greater part {{convert|600|km²|0|abbr=out}} lies in Slovakia. They are divided into several parts.

To the north, close to the Polish border, are the [[High Tatras]] which are a popular [[hiking]] and [[skiing]] destination and home to many scenic lakes and valleys as well as the highest point in Slovakia, the [[Gerlachovský štít]] at {{convert|2655|m|ft|0}} and the country's highly symbolic mountain [[Kriváň (peak)|Kriváň]]. To the west are the [[Western Tatras]] with their highest peak of [[Rysy]] at {{convert|2503|m|ft|0}} and to the east are the [[Belianske Tatras]], smallest by area.

Separated from the Tatras proper by the valley of the [[Váh]] river are the [[Low Tatras]], with their highest peak of [[Ďumbier]] at {{convert|2043|m|ft|0}}.

The Tatra mountain range is represented as one of the three hills on the [[coat of arms of Slovakia]].

[[File:Ochtina Aragonite Cave 27.jpg|thumb|right| [[Ochtinska Aragonite Cave]]]] 
Slovakia has hundreds of caves and caverns under its mountains, out of which 15 are open to the public. Most of the caves have stalagmites rising from the ground and stalactites hanging from above. There are currently five Slovak caves under [[UNESCO]]'s World Heritage Site status. They are [[Dobšinská Ice Cave]], [[Domica]], [[Gombasek Cave]], [[Jasovská Cave]] and [[Ochtinská Aragonite Cave]]. Other caves open to public include [[Belianska Cave]], [[Demänovská Cave of Liberty]], [[Demänovská Ice Cave]] or [[Bystrianska Cave]]

===Rivers===
{{Main|List of rivers of Slovakia}}

Most of the rivers stem in Slovak mountains. Some are only passing through and the others make a natural border with surrounding countries (more than {{convert|620|km|mi|0}}). For example [[Dunajec]] ({{convert|17|km|mi|0}}) to the north, [[Danube River|Danube]] ({{convert|172|km|mi|0}}) to the south or [[Morava (river)|Morava]] ({{convert|119|km|mi|0}}) to the West. The total length of the rivers on Slovak territory is {{convert|49774|km|mi|0}}.

The longest river in Slovakia is [[Vah River|Váh]] ({{convert|403|km|mi|0}}), the shortest is  Čierna voda. Other important and large rivers are [[Myjava (river)|Myjava]], [[Nitra (river)|Nitra]] ({{convert|197|km|mi|0}}), [[Orava (river)|Orava]], [[Hron]] ({{convert|298|km|mi|0}}), [[Hornád]] ({{convert|193|km|mi|0}}), [[Sajó|Slaná]] ({{convert|110|km|mi|0}}), [[Ipeľ]] ({{convert|232|km|mi|0}}, making the border with Hungary), [[Bodrog]], [[Laborec]], [[Latorica]] and [[Ondava]].

The biggest volume of discharge in Slovak rivers is during [[Spring (season)|spring]], when the snow is melting from the mountains. The only exception is Danube, whose discharge is the biggest during summer when the snow is melting in the [[Alps mountains|Alps]]. Danube is the largest river that flows through Slovakia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nie ste prihlásený. |url=http://www.slovakregion.sk/vodstvo-jazera-rieky-rybniky-slovenska |title=Translated from Slovak language |publisher=Slovakregion.sk |accessdate=2013-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lakes===
[[File:Strbske pleso slovakia.jpg|thumb|right| [[Štrbské pleso]] natural lake is a popular tourist destination in the High Tatras]]
There are around 175 naturally formed [[Tarn (lake)|tarns]] in [[High Tatras]]. With an area of 20 ha and its depth of {{convert|53|m|ft|0}}, [[Veľké Hincovo pleso]] is the largest and the deepest tarn in Slovakia. Other tarns in the High Tatras include [[Štrbské pleso]], [[Popradské pleso]], [[Skalnaté pleso]], [[Zbojnícke pleso]], [[Velické pleso]], [[Žabie pleso]], [[Krivánske zelené pleso]] or [[Roháčske plesá]]. Other than in the High Tatras there are [[Vrbické pleso]] in [[Low Tatras]], [[Morské oko (Slovakia)|Morské oko]] and [[Vinné jazero]] in [[Vihorlat Mountains]] or [[Jezerské jazero]] in [[Spišská Magura]].

The largest dams on the river Váh are [[Liptovská Mara]] and [[Sĺňava]]. Other well known dams are [[Oravská priehrada]] in the north, [[Zemplínska Šírava]] and [[Domaša]] in the east, [[Senecké jazerá]], [[Zlaté piesky]] or [[Zelená voda]] in the west.

===Climate===
The Slovak climate lies between the temperate and [[continental climate]] zones with relatively warm summers and cold, cloudy and humid winters. Temperature extremes are in interval between {{convert|-41|to|40.3|C|F|1}} although temperatures below {{convert|-30|°C|0}} are rare. The weather differs from the mountainous North to the plain South.

The warmest region is [[Bratislava]] and Southern Slovakia where the temperatures may rise up to {{convert|30|°C|0|abbr=on}} in summer, occasionally to {{convert|37|°C|0|abbr=on}}. During night, the temperatures rise up to {{convert|20|°C|0|abbr=on}}. The daily temperatures in winter average in the range of {{convert|-5|°C|0|abbr=on}} up to {{convert|10|°C|0|abbr=on}}. During night it may be freezing, but usually not below {{convert|-10|°C|0|abbr=on}}.

Summer in Northern Slovakia is usually mild with temperatures around {{convert|25|°C|0|abbr=on}} (less in the mountains). Winters are colder in the mountains, where the snow usually lasts until March and April and the night temperatures go down to {{convert|-20|°C|0|abbr=on}} and colder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slovensko.com/about/weather-climate |title=Based on the &quot;Climate&quot; article from |publisher=www.slovensko.com |accessdate=2013-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biodiversity==
Slovakia signed the Rio [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] on 19 May 1993, and became a party to the convention on 25 August 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbd.int/convention/parties/list/ |title=List of Parties |accessdate=8 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has subsequently produced a [[Biodiversity action plan|National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan]], which was received by the convention on 2 November 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbd.int/doc/world/sk/sk-nbsap-01-p1-en.pdf |title=National Biodiversity Strategy of Slovakia |accessdate=8 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The biodiversity of Slovakia comprises animals (such as annellids, arthropods, molluscs, nematodes and vertebrates), fungi ([[Ascomycota]], [[Basidiomycota]], [[Chytridiomycota]], [[Glomeromycota]] and [[Zygomycota]]), micro-organisms (including [[Mycetozoa]]), and plants.

===Fungi===
Over 4000 species of fungi have been recorded from Slovakia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cybertruffle.org.uk/robigalia/eng |title=Cybertruffle's Robigalia. Observations of fungi and their associated organisms |accessdate=8 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pavel Lizoň &amp; Kamila Bacigálová, ''Huby - Fungi'' in F. Hindák [ed.] Checklist of Non-vascular and Vascular Plants of Slovakia (Bratislava, 1998), pp. 102–227.&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, nearly 1500 are lichen-forming species&lt;ref&gt;Ivan Pišút, ''Lichenizované Huby (Lišajníky) - Lichen-forming Fungi (Lichens)'' in F. Hindák [ed.] Checklist of Non-vascular and Vascular Plants of Slovakia (Bratislava, 1998), pp. 229–295.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these fungi are undoubtedly endemic, but not enough is known to say how many. Of the lichen-forming species, about 40% have been classified as threatened in some way. About 7% are apparently extinct, 9% endangered, 17% vulnerable, and 7% rare. The conservation status of non-lichen-forming fungi in Slovakia is not well documented, but there is a red list for its larger fungi.&lt;ref&gt;Pavel Lizoň, ''Threatened macrofungi in Slovakia'' Biologia (Bratislava) 50: 9-12(1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Andrejkiska.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Andrej Kiska]], President of Slovakia]]

Slovakia is a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary democratic]] republic with a [[multi-party system]]. The last [[Slovak parliamentary election, 2012|parliamentary elections]] were held on 10 March 2012 and two rounds of [[Slovak presidential election, 2014|presidential elections]] took place on 15 and 29 March 2014.

The Slovak [[head of state]] is the president (currently [[Andrej Kiska]]), elected by direct popular vote for a five-year term. Most [[executive (government)|executive]] power lies with the [[head of government]], the prime minister (currently [[Robert Fico]]), who is usually the leader of the winning party, but he/she needs to form a majority coalition in the parliament. The prime minister is appointed by the president. The remainder of the cabinet is appointed by the president on the recommendation of the prime minister.

Slovakia's highest [[legislature|legislative]] body is the 150-seat [[unicameralism|unicameral]] [[National Council of the Slovak Republic]] (''Národná rada Slovenskej republiky''). Delegates are elected for a four-year term on the basis of [[proportional representation]]. Slovakia's highest [[judiciary|judicial body]] is the [[Constitutional Court of Slovakia]] (''Ústavný súd''), which rules on constitutional issues. The 13&amp;nbsp;members of this court are appointed by the president from a slate of candidates nominated by parliament.

Slovakia has been a member state of the European Union and [[NATO]] since 2004. As a member of the United Nations (since 1993), Slovakia was, on 10 October 2005, elected to a two-year term on the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]] from 2006 to 2007. Slovakia is also a member of WTO, OECD, [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]], and other international organizations.

The [[Constitution of Slovakia|Constitution of the Slovak Republic]] was ratified 1 September 1992, and became effective 1 January 1993). It was amended in September 1998 to allow [[direct election]] of the president and again in February 2001 due to EU admission requirements.
The [[civil law (legal system)|civil law system]] is based on Austro-Hungarian codes. The [[code (law)|legal code]] was modified to comply with the obligations of [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|Organization on Security and Cooperation in Europe]] (OSCE) and to expunge the [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] [[Law|legal theory]]. Slovakia accepts the compulsory [[International Court of Justice]] jurisdiction with reservations.

The president is the head of state and the formal head of the executive, though with very limited powers. The president is elected by direct, popular vote under the [[two-round system]] for a five-year term.

Following National Council elections, the leader of the [[Two-party system|majority party]] or the leader of the majority coalition is usually appointed prime minister by the president. Cabinet appointed by the president on the recommendation of the prime minister has to receive the majority in the parliament.

===Foreign relations===
{{Main|Foreign relations of Slovakia}}

Slovakia has been a member of [[European Union]] since 2004. Slovakia has been an active participant in U.S.- and NATO-led military actions. There is a joint Czech-Slovak peacekeeping force in Kosovo.

Slovakia is a member of the [[United Nations]] and participates in its specialized agencies. It is a member of the [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]] (OSCE), the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), and the [[OECD]]. It also is part of the [[Visegrad Four]] (Slovakia, [[Hungary]], [[Czech Republic]], and [[Poland]]), a forum for discussing areas of common concern.

The Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic entered into a [[Customs Union]] upon the division of Czechoslovakia in 1993, which facilitates a relatively free flow of goods and services. Slovakia maintains [[diplomacy|diplomatic relations]] with 134 countries, primarily through its [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Slovakia)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]]. There are 44 embassies and 35 honorary consulates in [[Bratislava]].

===Military===
{{Main|Military of Slovakia}}
[[File:Soldiers from 12th Mechanized Battalion of 1st Mechanized Brigade2.jpg|thumb|Slovak soldiers from 12th Mechanized Battalion.]]
The Armed Forces of the Slovak Republic number 14,000 uniformed personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novinky.cz/zahranicni/evropa/239481-slovenska-armada-se-zbavi-tanku.html?ref=stalo-se |title=Slovenská armáda se zbaví tanků – |publisher=Novinky.cz |accessdate=2013-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slovakia joined [[NATO]] in March 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nato.int/docu/update/2004/03-march/e0329a.htm |title=NATO Update: Seven new members join NATO|publisher=Nato.int |date=2004-03-26 |accessdate=2013-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2006 the army transformed into a fully professional organization and compulsory military service was abolished.

Slovak [[Ground Forces of the Slovak Republic|Ground Forces]] are made up of two active [[mechanized infantry]] [[brigades]]. The [[Slovak Air Force|Air and Air Defence Forces]] comprise one [[wing]] of [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]], one wing of utility [[helicopter]]s, and one SAM brigade. Training and support forces comprise a National Support Element (Multifunctional Battalion, Transport Battalion, Repair Battalion), a garrison force of the capital city Bratislava, as well as a training battalion, and various logistics and communication and information bases. Miscellaneous forces under the direct command of the [[General Staff]] include the [[5th Special Forces Regiment (Slovakia)|5th Special Forces Regiment]].

===Human rights===
{{Main|Human rights in Slovakia}}
The U.S. State Department in 2010 reported:
:&quot;The government generally respected the human rights of its citizens; however, there were problems in some areas. Notable human rights problems included some continuing reports of police mistreatment of Romani suspects and lengthy pretrial detention; restrictions on freedom of religion; concerns about the integrity of the judiciary, corruption in national government, local government, and government health services; violence against women and children; trafficking in women and children; and societal discrimination and violence against Roma and other minorities.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Dept. of State, [http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2009/eur/136057.htm &quot;2009 Human Rights Report: Slovakia&quot; 11 March 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

Human rights in Slovakia are guaranteed by the [[Constitution of Slovakia]] from the year 1992 and by multiple international laws signed in Slovakia between 1948 and 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mzv.sk/servlet/content?MT=/App/WCM/main.nsf/vw_ByID/zahranicna__politika&amp;TG=BlankMaster&amp;URL=/App/WCM/main.nsf/vw_ByID/medzinarodne_zmluvy-zmluvy_podla_predmetu&amp;CTYPE=%C4%BDudsk%C3%A9%20pr%C3%A1va&amp;OpenDocument=Y&amp;LANG=SK&amp;PAGE_VSETKYZMLUVY-DWMCEA-7XEM76=1 |title=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Slovakia – list of international acts relating to human rights |publisher=Mzv.sk |accessdate=2013-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slovakia [[Slovak nationality law|excludes multiple citizenships]].

===Administrative divisions===
{{Main|Regions of Slovakia|Districts of Slovakia}}
As for [[administrative division]], Slovakia is subdivided into 8 ''[[kraj]]ov'' (singular – ''kraj'', usually translated as &quot;region&quot;), each of which is named after its principal city. Regions have enjoyed a certain degree of autonomy since 2002. Their [[Self-governance|self-governing]] bodies are referred to as Self-governing (or autonomous) Regions (sg. ''samosprávny kraj'', pl. ''samosprávne kraje'') or Upper-Tier Territorial Units (sg. ''vyšší územný celok'', pl. ''vyššie územné celky'', abbr. VÚC).

The &quot;kraje&quot; are subdivided into many ''[[okres]]ov'' (sg. ''okres'', usually translated as districts). Slovakia currently has 79&amp;nbsp;districts.

In terms of economics and [[unemployment|unemployment rate]], the western regions are richer than eastern regions; however the relative difference is no bigger than in most EU countries having regional differences.

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of Slovakia}}

[[File:Slovakia Export Treemap.png|thumb|upright|350px|A graphical depiction of Slovakia's product exports in 28 color-coded categories.]]
[[File:Eurozone.svg|thumb|upright|Slovakia is part of the [[Schengen Area]], the EU single market, and since 2009, the [[Eurozone]] (dark blue)]]

The Slovak economy is considered an [[Developed country|advanced economy]], with the country dubbed the &quot;[[Tatra Tiger]]&quot;. Slovakia transformed from a centrally [[planned economy]] to a market-driven economy. Major [[privatization]]s are nearly complete, the banking sector is almost completely in private hands, and foreign investment has risen.

Before the [[financial crisis of 2007–08]], Slovakia had experienced high and sustained economic growth. In 2007 (with [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] growth of 10.5%), 2008 (6%) and 2010 (with 4%), Slovakia was the fastest growing economy in the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/european_economy/2012/pdf/ee-2012-1_en.pdf |title=Statistical data and prediction of the European Commission |format=PDF |accessdate=2013-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 (with the GDP growth of 3.3%) and 2012 (GDP growth of 1.8%), Slovakia was the 2nd fastest growing [[Eurozone]] member after [[Estonia]]. Slovakia's GDP growth of 0.9% in 2013 remains one of the highest in the [[Eurozone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;plugin=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tec00115 |title=Real GDP growth rate - volume |accessdate=2014-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ratio of government debt to GDP in Slovakia reached 58% by the end of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_PUBLIC/2-23102013-AP/EN/2-23102013-AP-EN.PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

Unemployment, peaking at 19% at the end of 1999, decreased to 7.5% in October 2008 according to the Statistical Office of the Slovak Republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iii.co.uk/news/?type=afxnews&amp;articleid=6608367&amp;subject=companies&amp;action=article |title=Slovak unemployment falls to 7.8% in Feb from Jan from Thomson Financial News Limited |publisher=Iii.co.uk |accessdate=16 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to economic growth, migration of workers to other EU countries also contributed to this reduction. According to [[Eurostat]], which uses a calculation method different from that of the Statistical Office of the Slovak Republic, the unemployment rate in September 2012 is at 13.9% &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/images/5/5e/Unemployment_rates%2C_seasonally_adjusted%2C_September_2012.png |title=Eurostat graph of unemployment in Europe Sep. 2012 |accessdate=2013-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; the third highest in the Eurozone (after Spain and Portugal).

Inflation dropped from an average annual rate of 12% in 2000 to just 3.3% in 2002, an election year, but it rose again in 2003–2004 because of rising labor costs and taxes. It reached only 1% in 2010 which is the lowest recorded rate since 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ako-investovat.sk/index.php/inflacia-na-slovensku |title=Inflation in Slovakia since 1993 |publisher=Ako-investovat.sk |accessdate=2013-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rate was at 4% in 2011.

Slovakia adopted the Euro currency on 1 January 2009 as the 16th member of the Eurozone. The euro in Slovakia was approved by [[European Commission|the European commission]] on 7 May 2008. The [[Slovak koruna]] was revalued on 28 May 2008 to 30.126 for 1 euro,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/feedarticle/7546478|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20080601034210/http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/feedarticle/7546478|archivedate=1 June 2008|title=Slovakia revalues currency ahead of euro entry|first=Marcin|last=Grajewski|work=The Guardian|date=28 May 2008|accessdate=9 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was also the exchange rate for the euro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7495169.stm|title=Slovak euro exchange rate is set|publisher=BBC News|date=8 July 2008|accessdate=9 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slovakia is an attractive country for [[Investment|foreign investors]] mainly because of its low wages, low tax rates and well educated [[labor force|labour force]]. In recent years, Slovakia has been pursuing a policy of encouraging foreign investment. [[foreign direct investment|FDI]] inflow grew more than 600% from 2000 and cumulatively reached an all-time high of $17.3&amp;nbsp;billion in 2006, or around $22,000 per capita by the end of 2008.

Despite a sufficient number of researchers{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} and a decent secondary [[education in Slovakia|educational system]],{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} Slovakia, along with other [[Post-Communism|post-communist]] countries, still faces major challenges in the field of the [[knowledge economy]]. The business and public [[research and development]] expenditures are well below the EU average. The [[Programme for International Student Assessment]], coordinated by the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]], currently ranks Slovak secondary education the 30th in the world (placing it just below the United States and just above Spain).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/42/8/39700724.pdf |title=Range of rank on the PISA 2006 science scale at OECD |format=PDF |accessdate=16 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2008, the Ministry of Finance announced that Slovakia's economy is developed enough to stop being an aid receiver from the [[World Bank]]. Slovakia became an aid provider at the end of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tasr.sk/30.axd?k=20080312TBB00600 |title=Slovakia Is Sufficiently Developled to Offer Aid Within World Bank at TASR |publisher=Tasr.sk |accessdate=16 October 2010}}{{dead link|date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industry===
Although Slovakia's GDP comes mainly from the tertiary (services) sector, the industrial sector also plays an important role within its economy. The main industry sectors are [[Automobile|car]] manufacturing and [[electrical engineering]]. Since 2007, Slovakia has been the world's largest producer of cars per capita,&lt;ref name=Kia&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.industryweek.com/ReadArticle.aspx?ArticleID=16083 |title=Slovak Car Industry Production Almost Doubled in 2007 |publisher=Industryweek.com |date=9 April 2008 |accessdate=16 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a total of 571,071 cars manufactured in the country in 2007 alone.&lt;ref name=Kia/&gt; There are currently three automobile assembly plants: [[Volkswagen]]'s in [[Bratislava]], [[PSA Peugeot Citroën]]'s in [[Trnava]] and [[Kia Motors]]' [[Kia Design and Manufacturing Facilities#Žilina Plant|Žilina Plant]].

From electrical engineering companies, [[Sony]] has a factory at [[Nitra]] for [[LCD television|LCD TV]] manufacturing, [[Samsung Group|Samsung]] at [[Galanta]] for [[computer monitor]]s and television sets manufacturing.

ESET is an IT security company from Bratislava with more than 500 employees worldwide at present. Their branch offices are in the United States, [[Ireland]], United Kingdom, [[Argentina]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Singapore]] and [[Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eset.com/me/about/profile/history/|title=About ESET: Company Profile: History|publisher=ESET|accessdate=2011-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bratislava's geographical position in Central Europe has long made Bratislava a crossroads for [[international trade]] traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|url=http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9273337/Bratislava,-Slovakia|title=Bratislava in Encyclopædia Britannica|year=2007|accessdate=30 April 2007}}{{dead link|date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=City of Bratislava|url=http://www.visit.bratislava.sk/en/vismo/dokumenty2.asp?id_org=700014&amp;id=1088&amp;p1=1800|title=MIPIM 2007 – Other Segments|year=2007|accessdate=30 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various ancient [[trade route]]s, such as the [[Amber Road]] and the [[Danube]] waterway, have crossed territory of present-day Bratislava. Today, Bratislava is the road, railway, waterway and airway hub.&lt;ref name=&quot;transport&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher=City of Bratislava|url=http://www.visit.bratislava.sk/en/vismo/dokumenty2.asp?id_org=700014&amp;id=1047&amp;p1=1815|title=Transport and Infrastructure|year=2007|accessdate=12 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energy===

In 2012, Slovakia produced a total of 28 393 [[Gigawatt-hour|GWh]] of [[electricity]] while at the same time consumed 28 786 GWh. The slightly higher level of consumption than the capacity of production (- 393 GWh) meant the country was not self-sufficient in energy sourcing. Slovakia imported electricity mainly from the [[Czech Republic]] (9 961 GWh - 73.6% of total import) and exported mainly to [[Hungary]] (10 231 GWh - 78.2% of total export).

[[Nuclear power|Nuclear energy]] accounts for 53.8% of total electricity production in Slovakia, followed by 18.1% of [[Thermal power station|thermal power]] energy, 15.1% by [[hydro power]] energy, 2% by [[solar energy]], 9.6% by other sources and the rest 1.4% is imported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Electricity consumption / production in Slovakia in 2012|url=http://www.sepsas.sk/seps/dokumenty/RocenkySed/Rocenka_SED_2012.pdf|title=National Control Centre of Slovakia|year=2013|accessdate=3 October 2013|language=Slovak, English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two nuclear power-plants in Slovakia are in [[Jaslovské Bohunice Nuclear Power Plant|Jaslovské Bohunice]] and [[Mochovce Nuclear Power Plant|Mochovce]], each of them containing two operating reactors. Prior to the accession of Slovakia to the EU in 2004, the government agreed to turn-off the V1 block of [[Jaslovské Bohunice Nuclear Power Plant|Jaslovské Bohunice power-plant]], built by [[Soviet Union]] in 1978. After deactivating the last of the two reactors of the V1 block in 2008, Slovakia instantly stopped being self-dependent in energy production. Currently there is another block (V2) with two active reactors in [[Jaslovské Bohunice Nuclear Power Plant|Jaslovské Bohunice]]. It is scheduled for decommissioning in 2025. The nuclear power production in Slovakia sometimes draws attention to [[Austria]]n green-energy activists who occasionally organize protests and block the borders between the two countries.

There are four main highways D1 to D4 and eight express ways R1 to R8. Most of them are still in the planning phase.

The [[Motorway D1 (Slovakia)|D1 motorway]] connects Bratislava to [[Trnava]], [[Nitra]], [[Trenčín]], [[Žilina]] and beyond, while the [[Motorway D2 (Slovakia)|D2 motorway]] connects it to [[Prague]], [[Brno]] and [[Budapest]] in the north-south direction. The [[Motorway D4 (Slovakia)|D4&amp;nbsp;motorway]] (an outer bypass), which would ease the pressure on Bratislava's highway system, is mostly at the planning stage.

The [[Nordostautobahn|A6&amp;nbsp;motorway]] to [[Vienna]] connects Slovakia directly to the Austrian motorway system and was opened on 19 November 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Pravda (Slovakia)|Pravda]]|url=http://www.tvojepeniaze.sk/do-viedne-uz-netreba-ist-po-okresnej-ceste-fgy-/sk_pludia.asp?c=A071119_072754_sk_pludia_p01|title=Do Viedne už netreba ísť po okresnej ceste|year=2007|accessdate=19 November 2007|language=Slovak}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Bratislava there are currently five bridges standing over the [[Danube]] (ordered by the flow of the river): [[Lafranconi Bridge]], [[Nový Most]] (The New Bridge), [[Starý most (Bratislava)|Starý most]] (The Old Bridge), [[Apollo Bridge|Most Apollo]] and [[Prístavný most]] (The Harbor Bridge).

The city's inner network of roadways is made on the radial-circular shape. Nowadays, the city experiences a sharp increase in the road traffic, increasing pressure on the road network. There are about 200,000 registered cars in Bratislava, (approximately 2 inhabitants per car).&lt;ref name=&quot;transport&quot;/&gt;

Bratislava's [[M.&amp;nbsp;R.&amp;nbsp;Štefánik Airport]] is the main [[international airport]] in Slovakia. It is located 9&amp;nbsp;kilometres (5.59 [[Mile|mi]]) northeast of the city centre. It serves civil and governmental, scheduled and unscheduled domestic and international flights. The current runways support the landing of all common types of aircraft currently used. The airport has enjoyed rapidly growing passenger traffic in recent years; it served 279,028&amp;nbsp;passengers in 2000, 1,937,642 in 2006 and 2,024,142 in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Letisko M.R.

The [[Port of Bratislava]] is one of the two international [[port|river ports]] in Slovakia. The port connects Bratislava to international boat traffic, especially the interconnection from the [[North Sea]] to the [[Black Sea]] via the [[Rhine–Main–Danube Canal|Rhine-Main-Danube Canal]].
Additionally, tourist lines operate from Bratislava's passenger port, including routes to [[Devín]], [[Vienna]] and elsewhere.

More than 1.6&amp;nbsp;million people visited Slovakia in 2006, and the most attractive destinations are the capital of [[Bratislava]] and the [[High Tatras]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Aktualne.sk|url=http://aktualne.centrum.sk/cestovanie/clanek.phtml?id=240802|title=The number of tourists in Slovakia is increasing (''Turistov na Slovensku pribúda'')|date=30 June 2007|accessdate=30 December 2007|language=Slovak}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most visitors come from the Czech Republic (about 26%), Poland (15%) and Germany (11%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Monika Martišková, Joj.sk|url=http://www.joj.sk/ekonomika/20-9-2007/clanok/na-slovensko-chodi-stale-najviac-turistov-z-cr.html|title=Most tourists in Slovakia still come from the Czech Republic (''Na Slovensko chodí stále najviac turistov z ČR'')|date=20 September 2007|accessdate=28 November 2007|language=Slovak}}{{dead link|date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical souvenirs from Slovakia are dolls dressed in folk costumes, ceramic objects, crystal glass, carved wooden figures, [[črpák]]s (wooden pitchers), [[fujara]]s (a [[folk instrument]] on the UNESCO list) and [[valaška]]s (a decorated folk hatchet) and above all products made from [[husk|corn husks]] and wire, notably human figures.

Souvenirs can be bought in the shops run by the state organization ÚĽUV (''Ústredie ľudovej umeleckej výroby'' – Center of [[Folk art|Folk Art]] Production). ''Dielo'' shop chain sells works of Slovak artists and craftsmen. These shops are mostly found in towns and cities.

Prices of imported products are generally the same as in the neighboring countries, whereas prices of local products and services, especially food, are usually lower.

[[File:Bodruzal cerkov06017008.JPG||thumb|This wooden church in [[Bodružal]] is an example of Slovak folk architecture and is a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]].]]

[[Folk]] tradition has rooted strongly in Slovakia and is reflected in literature, music, dance and architecture. The prime example is a Slovak national anthem, ''&quot;[[Nad Tatrou sa blýska]]&quot;'', which is based on a melody from ''&quot;[[Kopala studienku]]&quot;'' folk song.

Manifestation of Slovak folklore culture is the &quot;''Východná''&quot; Folklore Festival. It is the oldest and largest nationwide festival with international participation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=&quot;Východná&quot; festival|url=http://www.festivalvychodna.sk/en/}}&lt;/ref&gt; which takes place in [[Východná]] annually. Slovakia is usually represented by many groups but mainly by SĽUK (''Slovenský ľudový umelecký kolektív - Slovak folk art collective''). SĽUK is the largest Slovak folk art group, trying to preserve the folklore tradition.

An example of wooden folk architecture in Slovakia can be seen in the well preserved village of [[Vlkolínec]] which has been the [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] since 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UNESCO information about Vlkolínec|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/622}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eastern part of Slovakia, particularly the region of [[Spiš]], preserves the world's most remarkable folk wooden churches. Most of them are protected by Slovak law as [[cultural heritage]], but some of them are on the [[UNESCO]] list too, in Bodružal, Hervartov, Ladomirová and Ruská Bystrá.

The best known Slovak hero, found in many folk [[mythologies]], is [[Juraj Jánošík]] (1688–1713) (the Slovak equivalent of [[Robin Hood]]). The legend says he was taking from the rich and giving to the poor. Jánošík's life was depicted in a list of literature works and many movies throughout the 20th century. One of the most popular is a [[film]] ''Jánošík'' directed by [[Martin Frič]] in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jánošík movie on Czechoslovak Film Database|year=1935|url=http://www.csfd.cz/film/3113-janosik/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art===
[[Visual art]] in Slovakia is represented through [[painting]], [[drawing]], [[printmaking]], [[illustration]], [[Handicraft|arts and crafts]], [[sculpture]], [[photography]] or [[conceptual art]]. The supreme and central gallery institution displaying Slovak art nowadays is the [[Slovak National Gallery]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sng.sk/en/uvod/o-sng |title=About SNG – SNG |publisher=Sng.sk |accessdate=2012-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; established in 1949.

Well known sculptor of the 15th century Late [[Gothic art|Gothic]] era in Slovakia is the ''[[Master Paul of Levoča]]''. Although his work can be found in many places ([[Banská Bystrica]], [[Spišská Sobota]] or Lomnička), his most famous is a wooden [[altar]] in the Church of St. Jacob in [[Levoča]]. With its height of {{convert|18.62|m|ft|0}}, it is the tallest Gothic altar in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Altar information from the official portal of St. Jacob church in Levoča|url=http://www.chramsvjakuba.sk/en.html#hosjakuba}}&lt;/ref&gt; Well known painters of that time are the ''Master from Okoličné'', author of the altar in [[St. Elisabeth Cathedral]] in [[Košice]], and ''[[Master MS|Master M.S.]]'' of the 16th century, whose statue of Madonna can be seen in the Saint Catherine Church in [[Banská Štiavnica]]. The statues of Saint Catherine and Saint Barbara are in the art gallery of the Slovak Mining Museum in Banská Štiavnica.

'''19th century'''

The 19th century in Slovakia was a turbulent period of time when Slovaks began experiencing their national revival in the kingdom of [[Austria-Hungary]]. [[Romanticism]] of [[Jozef B. Klemens]] (1817–1883) and [[Peter Michal Bohúň]] (1822–1879) was represented in the portrait paintings of Slovak national protagonists of that time (Štefan Moyses, [[Andrej Sládkovič]], Karol Kuzmány or [[Ľudovít Štúr]]), depicting the revolutionary atmosphere of the 1840s in the background. Other important painters of the 19th century were mainly [[portraitist]]s Vojtech Angyal, Dominik Skutecký (1849–1921), J. Štetka, E. Ballo, Jozef Hanula (1863 – 1944), [[landscapist]] Karol Miloslav Lehotský (1846 – 1915) and [[impressionist]]s [[Maximilián Schurmann]] (1863 – 1944) and P. Kern.

[[Sculpture]] in the 19th century was dominated by a sacral sculptor Vavrinec Dunajský (1784 – 1833) and his son Ladislav Dunajský, author of [[Ján Hollý]] memorial in [[Dobrá Voda, Trnava District|Dobrá Voda]]. Another important sculptors were [[Ján Koniarek]] (1878 – 1952), [[Alojz Stróbl]] (1856 – 1926), [[Ján Fadrusz]] (1858 – 1903) and [[Alojz Rigele]] (1879–1940).

The inspiration of their work stems mainly from the lives of everyday people in Slovak [[rural area|rurals]] which they admired and idealized. The painters influenced by [[Art Nouveau]], [[symbolism (arts)|symbolism]] and [[expressionism]] are Zolo Palugyay (1898 – 1935), Anton Jasusch (1882–1965), [[Edmund Gwerk]] (1895–1956) or [[Július Jakoby]] (1903 – 1985). Important also is [[Blažej Baláž]] (1958).

Some of the most distinguished Slovak artists, whose work was closely linked to modern European art streams are [[Koloman Sokol]] (1902 – 2003), who became a professor of graphic techniques at the ''Escuela de las Artes del Libro'' and at the University of [[Mexico City]] from 1937 to 1941, [[Ľudovít Fulla]] (1902 – 1980) who received many international prices for his work&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.muzeum.sk/default.php?obj=galeria&amp;ix=sngglf |title=Galéria Ludovíta Fullu Ružomberok /* Ludovit Fulla Gallery Ruzomberok /Muzeum.SK - múzeum, galéria, hrad, zámok/ |publisher=Muzeum.sk |accessdate=2013-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Imro Weiner-Kráľ]] (1901 – 1978). The generation 1909 represent [[Cyprián Majerník]] (1909 – 1945), Ján Želibský, [[Ján Mudroch]] (1909 – 1968), Ladislav Čemický (1909 – 1968) and [[Ester M. Šimerová]] (1909).

Slovak [[graphic art]] experienced its peak during the 20th century. The most notable print-makers are [[Koloman Sokol]] (1902 – 2003), [[Vincent Hložník]] (1919 – 1997), [[Albín Brunovský]] (1935 – 1997), [[Dušan Kállay]] (1948), [[Vladimír Gažovič]] (1939), [[Karol Ondreička]] (1898 – 1961) or the young generation of artists Katarína Vavrová, Jozef Jankovič and Matej Krén.

[[Andy Warhol]] (1928–1987), a leading figure in the 20th century [[Art movement|visual art movement]] known as [[pop art]], was born in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] as ''Andrej Varchola'' to Slovak parents Ondrej Varchola (1889–1942) and [[Julia Warhola|Júlia]] (née Zavacká, 1892–1972).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warhola.com/biography.html |title=Biography |publisher=Warhola.com |accessdate=14 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A museum dedicated to him is in [[Medzilaborce]], where his parents lived.

Notable Slovak [[Photography|photographers]] in the 20th century are [[Martin Martinček]] (1913–2004) and [[Karol Kállay]] (1926–2012). Both Martinček and Kállay received the EFIAP (Excellence de la Fédération Internationale de l' Art Photographique) price in 1970.

Sculpture in the 20th century represent [[Ján Koniarek]] (1878 – 1952), [[Július Bártfay]] (1888 – 1979), [[Tibor Bártfay]] (1922) Ján Mathé (1922), [[Jozef Kostka]] (1912 – 1996), [[Ladislav Snopek]] (1919 – 2010), Rudolf Uher or Rudolf Hornák.

For a list of notable Slovak writers and poets, see [[Lists of Slovak authors|List of Slovak authors]].

Christian topics include: poem [[Proglas]] as a foreword to the four [[Gospel]]s, partial translations of the Bible into [[Old Church Slavonic]], ''Zakon sudnyj ljudem''.

[[Medieval literature]], in the period from the 11th to the 15th centuries, was written in [[Latin]], Czech and Slovakized Czech. Lyric (prayers, songs and formulas) was still controlled by the Church, while epic was concentrated on legends. Authors from this period include [[Johannes de Thurocz]], author of the [[Chronica Hungarorum]] and Maurus, both of them Hungarians.&lt;ref name=Phillips&gt;{{cite book |title=The dictionary of biographical reference: containing one hundred thousand names, together with a classed index of the biographical literature of Europe and America|last=Lawrence Barnett Phillips |first=|authorlink=|year=1871 |publisher=S. Low, Son, &amp; Marston |location=|isbn=|page=1020}}&lt;/ref&gt; The worldly literature also emerged and chronicles were written in this period.

There were two leading persons who codified the Slovak language. The first was [[Anton Bernolák]] whose concept was based on the western Slovak [[dialect]] in 1787. It was the codification of the first ever literary language of Slovaks. The second was [[Ľudovít Štúr]], whose formation of the Slovak language took principles from the central Slovak dialect in 1843.

Slovakia is also known for its polyhistors, of whom include [[Pavel Jozef Šafárik|Pavol Jozef Šafárik]], [[Matthias Bel|Matej Bel]], [[Ján Kollár]], and its political revolutionaries and reformists, such [[Milan Rastislav Štefánik]] and [[Alexander Dubček]].

Famous globetrotter and explorer, count [[Maurice Benyovszky|Móric Benyovszky]] had Slovak ancestors.

===Music===
{{Main|Music of Slovakia}}

[[File:BratislavaSND2.jpg|thumb|right|The new national theatre building]]

'''Classical music'''

The most important Slovak composers have been [[Eugen Suchoň]], [[Mikuláš Schneider-Trnavský]], [[Ján Cikker]], [[Ján Levoslav Bella]], [[Alexander Moyzes]] and [[Dezider Kardoš]], in the 21st century [[Vladimír Godár]] and [[Peter Machajdík]].

'''Pop music'''

[[Popular music]] began to replace [[folk music]] beginning in the 1950s, when Slovakia was still part of [[Czechoslovakia]]; American [[jazz]], [[Rhythm and blues|R&amp;B]], and [[rock and roll]] were popular, alongside [[waltz]]es, [[polka]]s, and [[Csárdás|czardas]], among other folk forms. By the end of the 1950s, radios were common household items, though only state stations were legal. Slovak popular music began as a mix of [[bossa nova]], [[cool jazz]], and rock, with [[propaganda|propagandistic]] lyrics. Dissenters listened to [[Österreichischer Rundfunk|ORF]] (Austrian Radio), [[Radio Luxemburg|Radio Luxembourg]], or [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|Slobodná Európa]] (Radio Free Europe), which played more rock.

Due to Czechoslovak isolation, the [[domestic market]] was active and many original bands evolved. Slovakia had a very strong [[Popular culture|pop culture]] during the 1970s and 1980s. This movement brought many original bands with their own unique interpretations of modern music. The quality of socialist music was very high. Stars such as [[Karel Gott]], Olympic, Pražský výběr (from the Czech Republic) or [[Elán (band)|Elán]], [[Modus (band)|Modus]], [[Tublatanka]], [[TEAM (Slovak band)|Team]] (from Slovakia) and many others were highly acclaimed and many recorded their LPs in [[foreign language]]s.

After the [[Velvet Revolution]] and the declaration of the Slovak state, domestic music dramatically diversified as [[Capitalism|free enterprise]] encouraged the formation of new bands and the development of new [[music genre|genres of music]]. Soon, however, major [[label]]s brought pop music to Slovakia and drove many of the small companies out of business. During the 1990s, American [[grunge]] and [[alternative rock]], and [[Britpop]] have a wide following, as well as a newfound enthusiasm for musicals.

'''Jazz'''

[[Peter Lipa]] (born 1943) is a well-known Slovak singer, composer and promoter of modern [[jazz]]. He is one of the main organizers of the &quot;[[Bratislava Jazz Days]]&quot; festival, which takes place in the capital city at the end of October each year since 1975. It is the biggest jazz venue in Slovakia.

[[Martin Valihora]] (1976), having been awarded a scholarship on the [[Berklee College of Music]] in Boston,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Well-rooted musicians can stretch their styles|date=18 April 2011|work=[[The Slovak Spectator]]|quote=The festival is the &quot;spiritual child&quot; of Valihora, a graduate of Berklee College of Music in Boston, USA,}}&lt;/ref&gt; he established himself as a part of the New York's jazz scene. He has been playing with the world's famous Japanese jazz [[pianist]] [[Hiromi Uehara]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The first (and only) name in jazz piano|date=5 December 2004|work=[[The Houston Chronicle]]|page=7 section:&quot;ZEST&quot;|quote=Hiromi&amp;nbsp;... makes her Houston debut&amp;nbsp;... with her trio, featuring electric bassist Tony Grey and drummer Martin Valihor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable Slovak jazz players are [[Laco Déczi]] (1938) -  composer, jazz trumpeter, [[Marián Varga]] (1947) - composer, organ player

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Cuisine of Slovakia}}
[[File:SkalickyTrdelnik.JPG|thumb|right|Slices of [[Trdelník#Skalický trdelník|Skalický trdelník]] - a traditional sweet pastry from the town of [[Skalica]]]]

Traditional Slovak cuisine is based mainly on [[pork]] meat, [[poultry]] ([[chicken]] is the most widely eaten, followed by [[duck]], [[goose]], and [[Turkey (bird)|turkey]]), [[flour]], [[potatoes]], [[cabbage]], and [[milk products]]. It is relatively closely related to [[Hungarian cuisine|Hungarian]], [[Czech cuisine|Czech]] and [[Austrian cuisine]]. On the east it is also influenced by [[Ukrainian cuisine|Ukrainian]] and [[Polish cuisine]]. In comparison with other European countries, [[Game (meat)|&quot;game meat&quot;]] is more accessible in Slovakia due to vast resources of forest and because hunting is relatively popular. [[Boar]], [[rabbit]], and [[venison]], are generally available throughout the year. [[Sheep|Lamb]] and [[goat]] are eaten but are not widely popular.

The traditional Slovak meals are [[bryndzové halušky]], [[bryndzové pirohy]] and other meals with potato dough and [[bryndza]]. Bryndza is a salty cheese made of a sheep milk, characterized by a strong taste and aroma. Bryndzové halušky must be on the menu of every traditional Slovak restaurant.

A typical soup is a [[sauerkraut]] soup (&quot;kapustnica&quot;). A [[Black pudding|blood sausage]] called &quot;jaternica&quot;, made from any and all parts of a butchered pig is also a specific slovak meal.

Wine is enjoyed throughout Slovakia. [[Slovak wine]] comes predominantly from the southern areas along the Danube and its tributaries; the northern half of the country is too cold and mountainous to grow grapevines. Traditionally, white wine was more popular than red or rosé (except in some regions), and [[Sweetness of wine|sweet wine]] more popular than dry, but in recent years tastes seem to be changing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slovakiasite.com/slovak-cuisine.php |title=Slovak Cuisine |publisher=Slovakiasite.com |accessdate=16 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beer (mainly of the [[pilsener]] style, though [[Dunkel|dark lagers]] are also consumed) is also popular.

===Sport===
[[File:Slovakia2010WinterOlympicscelebration2.jpg|thumb|right|The Slovak national ice hockey team celebrating a victory against [[Swedish national men's ice hockey team|Sweden]] at the [[2010 Winter Olympics]]]]

{{Main|Sport in Slovakia}}

Sport activities are practiced widely in Slovakia, many of them on a professional level. Among the most popular are [[ice hockey]], [[association football|football]], [[tennis]], [[Team handball|handball]], [[basketball]], [[volleyball]], [[whitewater slalom]] or [[athletics (sport)|athletics]].

'''Ice Hockey'''

One of the most popular collective sports in Slovakia is [[ice hockey]]. Slovakia became the member of [[IIHF]] on 2 February 1993 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iihf.com/sk/iihf-home/countries/slovakia.html |title=Slovakia |publisher=Iihf.com |date=2 February 1993 |accessdate=2012-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ever since has won 4 medals in [[Ice Hockey World Championships]], consisting of 1 gold, 2 silver and 1 bronze medal. The most recent success is a silver medal from [[2012 IIHF World Championship]] in [[Helsinki]]. Slovak national hockey team made five appearances in the Olympic games too, ended up 4th in the last [[2010 Winter Olympics]] in [[Vancouver]]. The country has 8280 registered players and is ranked 8th in the [[IIHF World Ranking]] at present. Prior to 2012, Slovak team [[HC Slovan Bratislava]] joined the [[Continental Hockey League]], considered the strongest hockey league in Europe, and the second-best in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iihf.com/fi/home-of-hockey/news/news-singleview/recap/6876.html|title=World of difference for KHL?|publisher=iihf.com|date=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slovakia organized the [[2011 IIHF World Championship]] in ice hockey in which the team of [[Finnish national hockey team|Finland]] won the gold medal. The venue took place in [[Bratislava]] and [[Košice]].

The most notable Slovak hockey players who played or are still playing in the [[National Hockey League]] are [[Stan Mikita]], [[Peter Šťastný]], [[Marian Šťastný]], [[Anton Šťastný]], [[Peter Bondra]], [[Žigmund Pálffy]], [[Marián Gáborík]], [[Marián Hossa]], [[Pavol Demitra]], [[Zdeno Chára]], [[Miroslav Šatan]], [[Ľubomír Višňovský]], [[Tomáš Kopecký]], [[Andrej Sekera]] or [[Jaroslav Halák]].

'''Whitewater slalom'''

[[Whitewater slalom]] is the most successful [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] sport in modern-day Slovakia. Apart from winning many World and European Championships, Slovak [[canoeists]] collected medals in each [[Summer Olympic Games]] since their first appearance in [[Atlanta 1996]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/slovakia |title=Slovakia &amp;#124; Slovak Olympic Committee &amp;#124; National Olympic Committee |publisher=Olympic.org |accessdate=2012-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jana Liptáková |url=http://spectator.sme.sk/articles/view/32450/9/slovakia_pins_hopes_on_water_slalom.html |title=Slovakia pins hopes on water slalom - The Slovak Spectator |publisher=Spectator.sme.sk |accessdate=2012-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The band achieved commercial success with the release of five studio albums, of which three debuted at number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. System of a Down has been nominated for four [[Grammy Awards]], and their song &quot;[[B.Y.O.B. (song)|B.Y.O.B.]]&quot; won the [[Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance|Best Hard Rock Performance]] of 2006. The group went on hiatus in August 2006 and reunited in November 2010, embarking on a [[System of a Down Reunion Tour|tour]] for the following three years. System of a Down has sold over 40 million records worldwide.

== History ==

=== Soil (1992–1994) ===
Serj Tankian and Daron Malakian attended [[Rose and Alex Pilibos Armenian School]] as children, although due to their eight-year age difference they did not meet until 1992 while working on separate projects at the same recording studio.&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, Ben. ''System Of A Down: Right Here In Hollywood'' (2007), p.&amp;nbsp;14.&lt;/ref&gt; They formed a band named ''Soil'' with Tankian on vocals and keyboards, Malakian on vocals and guitar, Dave Hakopyan (who later played in [[The Apex Theory]]/[[Mt. Helium]]) on bass and Domingo &quot;Dingo&quot; Laranio on drums. The band hired Shavo Odadjian (another Rose and Alex Pilibos alumnus) as manager, although he eventually joined Soil as rhythm guitarist. In 1994, after only one live show, and one jam session recording, Hakopyan and Laranio left the band, feeling that it was not going anywhere.

=== Demo tapes and signing (1994–1997) ===
After Soil split up, Tankian, Odadjian, and Malakian formed a new band, System of a Down. The group took its name from a poem that Malakian had written titled &quot;Victims of a Down&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;blogs.myspace.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=OnTroniK: System of a Down Information |url=http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&amp;friendId=512654515&amp;blogId=526325472 |accessdate=July 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word &quot;victims&quot; was changed to &quot;system&quot; because Odadjian believed that it would appeal to a much wider audience and also because the group wanted their records to be alphabetically shelved closer to their musical heroes, [[Slayer]]. Odadjian switched from guitar to bass and passed on his managerial duties to [[Velvet Hammer Music and Management Group]] and its founder David &quot;Beno&quot; Benveniste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Interview With David 'Beno' Benveniste |work=lamusicblog.com |date=March 13, 2011 |url=http://lamusicblog.com/2011/03/industry-profile/interview-with-beno-of-velvet-hammer |accessdate=August 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band recruited drummer [[Ontronik Khachaturian|Ontronik &quot;Andy&quot; Khachaturian]], an old school friend of Malakian's and Odadjian's who had played with Malakian in a band called Snowblind during their teens.&lt;ref name=&quot;blogs.myspace.com&quot; /&gt;

In early 1995, System played as &quot;Soil&quot; at the [[Cafe Club Fais Do-Do]] a nightclub in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]. Shortly after the event, System of a Down made what is known as ''Untitled 1995 Demo Tape'', which was not commercially released but appeared on file sharing networks around the time of the band's success with ''[[Toxicity (album)|Toxicity]]'' about six years later. ''Demo Tape 2'' was released in 1996. At the beginning of 1997, System of a Down recorded their final publicly released demo tape, ''Demo Tape 3''. In mid-1997, drummer Khachaturian left the band because of a hand injury (he subsequently co-founded The Apex Theory, which included former Soil bassist Dave Hakopyan).&lt;ref name=&quot;blogs.myspace.com&quot; /&gt; Khachaturian was replaced by John Dolmayan.

The band's first official release of a professionally recorded song was on a collection called ''Hye Enk'' (&quot;we're Armenian&quot; in English), an [[Armenian Genocide]] recognition compilation, in 1997. Soon after playing at notable Hollywood clubs such as the [[Whisky-A-Go-Go]] and [[Viper Room]] the band caught famed producer [[Rick Rubin]]'s attention who asked them to keep in touch with him. Showing great interest, the group recorded ''Demo Tape 4'' near the end of 1997. Unlike the previous demo tapes, however, ''Demo Tape 4'' was made only to be sent to [[Record label|record companies]] (although it has since been leaked onto the internet). Rubin signed the group onto his [[American Records|American/Columbia Records]], and System of a Down began to record in Rubin's studio, laying down tracks that would eventually be released on their debut album.

Also in 1997, the group won the Best Signed Band Award from the Rock City Awards.&lt;ref name=&quot;rc_awards_97&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Rock City Awards 1997 |work=rockcitynews.com |url=http://www.rockcitynews.com/awards/ballot97.html |accessdate=July 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''System of a Down'' (1998–2000) ===
In June 1998, System of a Down released their debut album, ''[[System of a Down (album)|System of a Down]]''. They enjoyed moderate success as their first singles &quot;[[Sugar (System of a Down song)|Sugar]]&quot; and &quot;[[Spiders (System of a Down song)|Spiders]]&quot; became radio favorites and the music videos for both songs were frequently aired on MTV. After the release of the album, the band toured extensively, opening for Slayer and [[Metallica]] before making their way to the second stage of [[Ozzfest]]. Following Ozzfest, they toured with [[Fear Factory]] and [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]] before headlining the [[Sno-Core Tour]] with [[Puya (band)|Puya]], [[Mr. Bungle]], The Cat and Incubus providing support.

In November 1998, System of a Down appeared on [[South Park]]'s ''[[Chef Aid: The South Park Album|Chef Aid]]'' album, providing the music for the song &quot;Will They Die 4 You?&quot; Near the end of the song Tankian can be heard saying, &quot;Why must we kill our own kind?&quot; a line that would later be used in the song &quot;Boom!&quot; Although System of a Down is credited on the album, South Park character [[Chef (South Park)|Chef]] does not introduce them as he does every other artist featured on the record.

System of a Down's former drummer, Ontronik Khachaturian, briefly reunited with the band at a show at [[The Troubadour (Los Angeles)|The Troubadour]] in 1999, filling in on vocals for an ill Tankian.&lt;ref name=&quot;blogs.myspace.com&quot; /&gt; In 2000, the band contributed their cover of the [[Black Sabbath]] song &quot;[[Snowblind (Black Sabbath song)|Snowblind]]&quot; to the Black Sabbath tribute album ''[[Nativity in Black 2]].''

=== ''Toxicity'' and ''Steal This Album!'' (2001–2003) ===
[[File:Daron Malakian 1.jpg|thumb|left|160px|Guitarist [[Daron Malakian]] met Serj Tankian for the first time in 1993 before forming the band a year later.]]
On September 3, 2001, System of a Down had planned on launching their second album at a free concert in Hollywood as a &quot;thank you&quot; to fans. The concert, which was to be held in a parking lot, was set up to accommodate 3,500 people, however, an estimated 7,000 to 10,000 fans showed up. Because of the large excess number of fans the performance was cancelled by police officers just before the group took the stage. No announcement was made that the concert had been cancelled. Fans waited for more than an hour for the group to appear, but when a banner hanging at the back of the stage that read &quot;System of a Down&quot; was removed by security, the audience rushed the stage, destroying all the band's touring gear (approximately $30,000 worth of equipment) and began to riot, throwing rocks at police, breaking windows, and knocking over portable toilets. The riot lasted six hours, during which six arrests were made. The band's manager, David &quot;Beno&quot; Benveniste, later said that the riot could have been avoided if the group had been permitted to perform or had they been allowed to make a statement at the concert regarding the cancellation. System of a Down's scheduled in-store performance the next day was cancelled to prevent a similar riot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=System Of A Down cancellation sparks riot |date=September 4, 2001 |publisher=Live Daily |url=http://www.soundspike.com/story2/3600/system-of-a-down-cancellation-sparks-riot/ |accessdate=July 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group's big break arrived when their second album ''[[Toxicity (album)|Toxicity]]'' debuted at No.1 on the American and Canadian charts, despite the events of September 11. The album has eventually achieved 3x [[multi-platinum]] certification in the [[United States|US]]&lt;ref name=RIAAcert&gt;[http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?artist=%22Toxicity%22 RIAA album certifications: System of a Down - Toxicity]&lt;/ref&gt; and has since sold over 12 million copies worldwide. It was still on top in America during the week of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] and the political environment caused by the attacks added to the controversy surrounding the album's hit single &quot;[[Chop Suey!]]&quot; The song was taken off the radio as it contained politically sensitive lyrics at the time such as &quot;(I don't think you) trust in my self-righteous suicide.&quot; Regardless, the video gained constant play on MTV as did the album's second single, &quot;[[Toxicity (song)|Toxicity]]&quot;. Even with the controversy surrounding &quot;Chop Suey!&quot; (which earned a Grammy nomination), System of a Down still received constant airplay in the United States throughout late 2001 and 2002 with &quot;Toxicity&quot; and &quot;[[Aerials (song)|Aerials]]&quot;. In May 2006, [[VH1]] listed Toxicity in the No.14 slot in the 40 Greatest Metal Songs.

In 2001, the band went on tour with [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]] throughout the United States and Mexico. Following a performance in Grand Rapids, Michigan, Odadjian was allegedly harassed, ethnically intimidated, and was physically assaulted by security guards backstage, who then dragged him out of the venue. Odadjian received medical attention from police and later filed a suit against the security company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1470460/20030310/system_of_a_down.jhtml|title=System Of A Down Bassist Sues Security Team For Humiliating Him In Front Of Fans|first=Gil|last=Kaufman|date=March 10, 2003 |publisher=MTV |accessdate=July 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the incident, the tour was a success and System of a Down and Slipknot went on the Pledge of Allegiance Tour with [[Rammstein]] in 2001.

In late 2001, unreleased tracks from the ''Toxicity'' sessions made their way onto the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glendalehigh.com/malakian.html|title=The Daron Malakian Interview|author=Mike Lancaster|date=March 28, 2003 |publisher=Glendale High School Newspaper-the Explosion|accessdate=July 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This collection of tracks was dubbed ''Toxicity II'' by fans. The group released a statement that the tracks were unfinished material and subsequently released the final versions of the songs as their third album, ''[[Steal This Album!]]'', which was released in November 2002. ''Steal This Album!'' resembled a burnable CD that was marked with a felt-tip marker. 50,000 special copies of the album with different CD designs were also released, each designed by a different member of the band. The name of the album is a reference to [[Abbie Hoffman]]'s counter-culture book, ''[[Steal This Book]]'' as well as a message to those who leaked the songs onto the internet. The song &quot;Innervision&quot; was released as a promo single and received constant airplay on alternative radio. A video for &quot;Boom!&quot; was filmed with director [[Michael Moore]] as a protest against the [[War in Iraq]].

=== ''Mezmerize'' and ''Hypnotize'' (2004–2006) ===
[[File:Serj Tankian.jpg|thumb|right|167px|[[Serj Tankian]] has gained a reputation for his large vocal range along with his unusual delivery.]]
Between 2004 to 2005, the group recorded the follow-up to ''Steal This Album!'', a double album, which they released as separate installments six months apart from each other, notably including album cover artwork by Malakian's father, Vartan Malakian, which was designed to connect the two separate album covers. The first album, ''[[Mezmerize (album)|Mezmerize]],'' was released on May 17, 2005 to favorable reviews by critics. It debuted at No.1 in the United States, Canada, Australia and all around the world, making it System of A Down's second No.1 album. First week sales rocketed to over 800,000 copies worldwide. The Grammy Award-winning single &quot;[[B.Y.O.B. (song)|B.Y.O.B.]]&quot;, which questions the integrity of military recruiting in America, worked its way up the Billboard Modern Rock and Mainstream Rock charts. The next single, &quot;[[Question!]]&quot; was released with Shavo Odadjian co-directing the music video. Following the release of ''Mezmerize,'' the band toured extensively throughout the United States and Canada with [[The Mars Volta]] and [[Bad Acid Trip]] supporting.

The second part of the double album, ''[[Hypnotize (album)|Hypnotize]],'' was released on November 22, 2005. Like ''[[Mezmerize (album)|Mezmerize]],'' it debuted at No.1 in the US, making System of a Down, along with [[The Beatles]], [[Guns N' Roses]], and rappers [[2Pac]] and [[DMX (rapper)|DMX]], the only artists to ever have two studio albums debut at No.1 in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Harris |first=Chris |date=November 30, 2005 |title=System of a Down Make It a Double with Chart-Topping Hypnotize |work=MTV News |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1516656/20051130/system_of_a_down.jhtml |accessdate=February 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2006, System of a Down won the Grammy for Best Hard Rock Performance for &quot;[[B.Y.O.B. (song)|B.Y.O.B.]]&quot;, beating out other established artists such as [[Nine Inch Nails]] and [[Robert Plant]]. Their second single off the Hypnotize album, &quot;[[Lonely Day]]&quot; was released in March in the United States. System of a Down released &quot;[[Kill Rock 'N Roll]]&quot; and &quot;[[Vicinity of Obscenity]]&quot; as their next [[Promotional recording|promo]] singles. The band headlined [[Ozzfest]] 2006 in cities where tour founder [[Ozzy Osbourne]] opted not to appear or was not playing on the main stage (with the exception of the show at Randall's Island, where Ozzy Osbourne headlined the second stage before System of a Down's performance that night).

Whereas on System of a Down's previous albums most of the lyrics were written and sung by Tankian and the music was co-written by Tankian and Malakian (and sometimes Odadjian), much of the music and lyrics on ''Mezmerize''/''Hypnotize'' were written by Malakian who also took on a much more dominant role as vocalist on both albums, often leaving Tankian providing keyboards and backing vocals.

System of a Down's song &quot;[[Lonely Day]]&quot; was nominated for Best Hard Rock Performance in the [[49th Grammy Awards nominees and winners|49th Grammy Awards]] in 2007, but lost to &quot;[[Woman (Wolfmother song)|Woman]]&quot; by [[Wolfmother]].

In May 2006, the band announced they were going on hiatus. Malakian confirmed the break would probably last a few years, which Odadjian specified as a minimum of three years in an interview with ''Guitar'' magazine. He told MTV, &quot;We're not breaking up. If that was the case, we wouldn't be doing this Ozzfest. We're going to take a very long break after Ozzfest and do our own things. We've done System for over ten years, and I think it's healthy to take some rest.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news  |last=Harris |first=Chris |date=May 3, 2006 |title=System of a Down Aren't Breaking Up—They're Going on Hiatus|work=MTV News |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1530066/20060503/system_of_a_down.jhtml |accessdate=February 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; System of a Down's final performance before their hiatus took place on August 13, 2006 in [[West Palm Beach]], Florida. &quot;Tonight will be the last show we play for a long time together,&quot; Malakian told the crowd during Sunday's last performance. &quot;We'll be back.

May 2006 also saw the UK publication of a biography of the band entitled ''System of a Down: Right Here in Hollywood'' by writer [[Ben Myers]]. It was published in the US in 2007 through [[The Disinformation Company]].

=== Hiatus (2006–2010) ===
Malakian announced he was forming a band called [[Scars on Broadway]], which was joined by Dolmayan.

Tankian released his debut solo album ''[[Elect the Dead]]'' in the autumn of 2007. Malakian and Dolmayan released Scars On Broadway's [[Scars on Broadway (album)|debut self-titled album]] on July 29, 2008. Dolmayan, alongside working with Scars on Broadway, formed his own band, [[Indicator (band)|Indicator]], as well as opened Torpedo Comics, an online comic book store.&lt;ref name=&quot;soadfans_comic&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=SOAD talk about side projects |work=soadfans.com |date=July 13, 2006 |url=http://www.soadfans.com/Article400.htm |accessdate=July 25, 2007 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070310170916/http://www.soadfans.com/Article400.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate=March 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Odadjian pursued his project with [[RZA]] of [[Wu-Tang Clan]], a hip-hop group named [[Achozen|AcHoZeN]], worked on his urSESSION website/record label, and performed as a member of funk legend [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]]'s backing band.

=== Reunion and touring (2010–present) ===
On November 29, 2010, following several weeks of Internet rumors, System of a Down officially announced that they would be reuniting for a string of large European festival dates in June 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Karan |first=Tim |title=System Of A Down to reunite, headline Download Festival |work=[[Alternative Press]] |date=November 29, 2010 |url=http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/system_of_a_down_to_reunite_co-headline_download_festival_with_avenged_seve/ |accessdate=November 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the announced tour dates included UK's [[Download Festival]], Switzerland's [[Greenfield Festival]], Germany's [[Rock am Ring and Rock im Park|Rock am Ring/Rock im Park]], Sweden's [[Metaltown]], Austria's [[Nova Rock Festival]] and Finland's [[Provinssirock]].

The band have continued playing around the world. On August 11 and 12, 2012, they played the [[Heavy MTL]] and [[Heavy T.O.]] music festivals in Montreal and Toronto, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://exclaim.ca/News/heavy_to_heavy_mtl_return_with_system_of_down_slipknot_marilyn_manson_cancer_bats_high_on_fire Heavy TO and Heavy MTL Return with System of a Down, Slipknot, Marilyn Manson, Cancer Bats, High on Fire]&lt;/ref&gt; On February 4, 2013, it was announced that System of a Down would play the UK's [[Reading and Leeds Festivals]] in August 2013, among other festivals and venues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.readingfestival.com/news/system-down-fall-out-boy-foals-and-more-confirmed-2013 System Of A Down, Fall Out Boy, Foals and more confirmed for 2013!]&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid March 2013, via their Facebook Page, the band hinted at an announcement of a show by posting pictures of famous Los Angeles Landmarks and asking fans to figure out &quot;where all roads lead&quot;. Several days later, it was announced that System of a Down would play their only US Date in 2013 at the Hollywood Bowl on July 29, 2013. Tickets sold out hours after going on sale on March 22.

Asked in August 2012 whether System of a Down will record a new album, frontman [[Serj Tankian]] said that the members of System of a Down have not &quot;really discussed another record as of now&quot;, although he later added, &quot;when it's the right time, it'll materialize, like everything else in the universe&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = System Of A Down Frontman: 'We Haven't Really Discussed Another Record'| work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]| date = August 3, 2012| url = http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=177656| accessdate = August 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in August, Dolmayan said that he would like to do a new System of a Down album in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = System Of A Down Drummer Hopes To Begin Work On New Album Next Year| work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]| date = August 6, 2012| url = http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=177762| accessdate = August 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 20, 2013 bassist Shavo Odadjian criticized Tankian on Facebook, accusing him of stopping the band from recording a sixth studio album. Odadjian stated, &quot;Its not us (Daron, John or Shavo) Its Serj, who doesn' want to do a new album!!!! so please stop harassing us about it!!! We are just waiting for SERJ! Now He might hate me for exposing the truth but i Had too.. Sorry folks!!! we're trying to get a new album out, its just not passing Serj’s RULES! . Kinda funny, since we started the band and now he’s holding us back!!&quot; {{sic}} He also went as far as to comment on the possibility of replacing Tankian to get an album out sooner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=System of a Down's Shavo Odadjian accuses Serj Tankian of holding up new album|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2013/05/system-of-a-downs-shavo-odadjian-accuses-serj-tankian-of-holding-up-new-album/|publisher=[[Consequence of Sound]] page|accessdate=22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While he has since removed the posts from his page, System of a Down's official Facebook page later responded to the posts. The statement said that his statements &quot;do not reflect the sentiments of System Of A Down as a collective band&quot; and that they came from &quot;a temporary state of bad judgment on his part alone&quot;. Regarding a new album, it also read &quot;although we have not agreed on a timetable for a new album, we all believe that having the four of us do it together is the way to be true to the band and our fans.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=System of a Down Facebook page|url=https://www.facebook.com/systemofadown/posts/10151481346374032|publisher=System of a Down Facebook page|accessdate=22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, while commenting on the possibility of new System of a Down material, singer Serj Tankian stated that he &quot;can't write a forced record&quot;, an action he described as &quot;romancing someone at a time you don't want to be romantic.&quot; He added that an album cycle requires three years and it is not &quot;something [he] can do right now.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Serj Tankian On New System Of A Down Album: 'It's Not Something I Can Do Right Now'|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=190821|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|accessdate=4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 26, 2013, Dolmayan revealed on Twitter that he had begun work on a covers album, which &quot;should be good practice&quot; for a new System of a Down album &quot;sometime in the future.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=System Of A Down Drummer Working On Covers Album|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/system-of-a-down-drummer-working-on-covers-album/|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|accessdate=30 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early July of 2014, Dolmayan touched on the topic of new music again in an interview with Loudwire magazine, saying there are some good reasons behind why the band has not entered the studio and recorded new music. However, despite this fact, he's not entirely happy with the current state of the band.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://loudwire.com/system-of-a-down-john-dolmayan-not-really-happy-where-band-is-right-now/ |title=John Dolmayan 'Not Happy' With Current State of System of a Down |publisher=Loudwire.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Politics====
All four members are of [[Armenians|Armenian descent]], and are widely known for their outspoken views expressed in many of their songs confronting the [[Armenian Genocide]] of 1915 as well as the ongoing [[War on Terrorism]].

Concert footage and interviews with the band concerning the importance of helping create awareness and recognition of the [[Armenian Genocide]] were featured in the 2006 film ''[[Screamers (2006 film)|Screamers]],'' directed by [[Carla Garapedian]]. An interview with Tankian's grandfather, a survivor of the Genocide, was also included in the film as well as Tankian's and Dolmayan's meeting with (then) Speaker of the House [[Dennis Hastert]] during which the two musicians campaigned for the United States government's official recognition of the Genocide. Footage of Tankian and Dolmayan marching with protesters outside of the Turkish embassy in Washington D.C. was also used in ''Screamers''.

=== Music ===
Stephen Thomas Erlewine of [[AllMusic]] stated &quot;Like many late-'90s [[Heavy metal music|metal]] bands, System of a Down struck a balance between '80s underground [[thrash metal]] and [[alternative metal|metallic early-'90s alternative rockers]] like [[Jane's Addiction]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Erlewine&quot; /&gt;

==History==

===Formation and early career (1984–1995)===
Ed Simons was born in [[Herne Hill]], [[South London]] on 9 June 1970 to a barrister mother and a father who was not around much when Simons was growing up. Simons' two main interests when he was young were [[aeroplanes]] and musicals. Simons attended two South London public schools, [[Alleyn's School]] and [[Dulwich College]]. During his school years, he developed a fondness for [[rare groove]] and [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] music, having frequented a club called The Mud Club from the age of 14. By the time he left school, his two main musical interests were two Manchester bands, [[New Order]] and [[The Smiths]]. After finishing school with 11 [[General Certificate of Education|O]] levels and three A-levels, he continued on to study history, especially late [[Middle Ages|medieval]] history, at the [[University of Manchester]].

Tom Rowlands, a childhood classmate of Simons', was born on 11 January 1971 in [[Kingston upon Thames]], London. When Rowlands was very young, his family relocated to [[Henley-on-Thames]]. He later attended [[Reading Blue Coat School]] in [[Berkshire]], during which time he became obsessed with Scotland, developing a fondness for the bagpipes in particular. In his early teens, his interest in music broadened to other genres. Initially, some of his favourites included the ''Oh What a Lovely War'' soundtrack, [[2 Tone]], the nascent [[gothic rock]] genre (Sisters of Mercy, Fields of the Nephilim) and the [[electro (music)|electro]] sounds of artists such as [[Kraftwerk]], [[New Order]], [[Cabaret Voltaire (band)|Cabaret Voltaire]], and [[Heaven 17]]. He described the [[Yo! Bum Rush the Show|first]] [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]] album as the record that probably changed his life, and commented that &quot;Miuzi Weighs a Ton&quot; was one of the most amazing tracks he had ever heard. Rowlands also started collecting [[hip hop]] records by artists like [[Eric B]] and [[Schoolly D]]. Rowlands left school with similar accomplishments to Simons', achieving nine O levels and three A levels. For university, he followed Simons to Manchester primarily to immerse himself in its music scene in general and the [[Fac 51 Hacienda|Haçienda]] in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.rhapsody.com/artist/Art.4017| title=Artist bio from Rhapsody|publisher=Rhapsody.com|accessdate=2014-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rowlands was also in a band called Ariel prior to meeting up with Simons.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Great Rock Discography&quot;/&gt; Ariel was formed in London by Rowlands and his friends Brendan Melck and Matt Berry. Their first single was &quot;Sea of Beats&quot;, which was essentially a [[white label]]. Before Philip Brown set up Echo Logik Records, their first promo was &quot;Bokadilo&quot;. Other songs, released on [[12&quot; single|12&quot;]], included &quot;Mustn't Grumble&quot; and their most well-known, &quot;Rollercoaster&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Great Rock Discography&quot;/&gt; After a year on Echo Logik they signed to the [[record label]] [[Deconstruction Records|deConstruction]]. They insisted that they get a female singer and they recruited former Xpansions frontwoman [[Sally Ann Marsh]], and after some disappointing songs like &quot;Let It Slide&quot; (Rowlands would later describe it as &quot;a stinker&quot;) the band fell apart. One of the last things Ariel did was the song &quot;T Baby&quot; which was remixed by the pair. In regards to the remix, Ed stated that &quot;Ariel symbolically ended when Deconstruction asked us for a Dust Brothers remix of an Ariel track. That was the final nail in the coffin&quot;. Tom would later say in a TV interview from 1995: &quot;One of the blokes went a bit mad, but now he's back at college, and the other one drives our van&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://planet-dust.laserjay.net/history.htm| title=Planet Dust Chemical Brothers History|publisher=Planet-dust.laserjay.net|accessdate=2014-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rowlands and Simons then started to [[Disc jockey|DJ]] at a club called &quot;Naked Under Leather&quot; in the back of a pub in 1992,&lt;ref name=&quot;The Great Rock Discography&quot;/&gt; under the alias of &quot;The 237 Turbo Nutters&quot; (named after the number of their house on Dickenson Road in Manchester and a reference to their Blackburn [[Rave culture|raving]] days). The pair would play hip hop, [[Techno music|techno]], and [[House music|house]].&lt;ref&gt;''Brothers Gonna Work It Out'' (XDUSTCD 101) booklet, page 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Rowlands and Simons called themselves The Dust Brothers,&lt;ref name=&quot;The Great Rock Discography&quot;/&gt; after [[Dust Brothers|the US production duo]] famous for their work with the [[Beastie Boys]]. After a while, they began to run out of suitable instrumental hip hop tracks to use, so they started to make their own. Using a [[Hitachi, Ltd.|Hitachi]] hi-fi system, a computer, a sampler, and a keyboard, they recorded &quot;Song to the Siren&quot;, which sampled [[This Mortal Coil]]. &quot;Song to the Siren&quot; was released on their own record label, called &quot;Diamond Records&quot; (after Ed's nickname). In October 1992, they pressed 500 white label copies and took them to various dance record shops around London, but none would play it, saying that it was too slow (the track played at 111 [[beats per minute|BPM]]). They sent a copy to London DJ [[Andrew Weatherall]], who made it a permanent fixture in his DJ sets. Weatherall also signed the band to his [[Junior Boy's Own]] label.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Great Rock Discography&quot;/&gt; In May 1993, Junior Boy's Own released &quot;Song to the Siren&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Great Rock Discography&quot;/&gt;

Around June 1993, the Dust Brothers did their first remixes. The first was &quot;Packet of Peace&quot; for Justin Robertson's [[Lionrock]] outfit, followed by tracks for [[Leftfield]], [[Republica]], and [[The Sandals]]. Late in 1993, The Dust Brothers completed work on their ''[[Fourteenth Century Sky]]'' [[Extended play|EP]], released in January 1994.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Great Rock Discography&quot;/&gt; It contained the ground-breaking &quot;Chemical Beats&quot;, which epitomized the duo's genre-defining [[big beat]] sound.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Great Rock Discography&quot;/&gt; The EP also contained &quot;One Too Many Mornings&quot;, which for the first time showed the less intense, more chilled-out side of The Dust Brothers. Both &quot;One Too Many Mornings&quot; and &quot;Chemical Beats&quot; would later appear on their debut album. ''Fourteenth Century Sky'' was followed later in 1993 by the ''[[My Mercury Mouth EP]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Great Rock Discography&quot;/&gt; &quot;Chemical Beats&quot; was also part of the soundtrack for the first edition of the [[Wipeout (game)|Wipeout]] games series, having been featured in ''Wipeout'' for the [[PlayStation]] in 1995.

In October 1994, The Dust Brothers became resident DJs at the small, but influential Heavenly Sunday Social Club at the Albany pub in London's [[Great Portland Street]]. [[Noel Gallagher]], [[Paul Weller (singer)|Paul Weller]], [[James Dean Bradfield]], and [[Tim Burgess (artist)|Tim Burgess]] were regular visitors. The Dust Brothers were subsequently asked to remix tracks by [[Manic Street Preachers]] and [[The Charlatans (British band)|The Charlatans]], plus [[Primal Scream]]'s &quot;Jailbird&quot; and [[The Prodigy]]'s &quot;Voodoo People&quot;. These two remixes received [[television]] exposure, being playlisted by [[MTV]] Europe's &quot;The Party Zone&quot; in 1995. Early in 1994, The Dust Brothers were approached in the club one Sunday by Noel Gallagher, from [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]], who at the time were becoming one of the most prominent guitar bands in Britain. Gallagher told the duo that he had a [[Ibiza|Balearic]]-inspired track which he had written and would like the Dust Brothers to remix. However, over time, Gallagher changed his mind, and in the end the Brothers did not remix it.

In March 1995, The Dust Brothers began their first international tour, which included the United States – where they played with [[Orbital (band)|Orbital]] and [[Underworld (band)|Underworld]] – then a series of European festivals. Also around this time, [[Dust Brothers|the original Dust Brothers]] threatened legal action over the use of their name, and so Rowlands and Simons had to decide on a new name.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Great Rock Discography&quot;/&gt; They decided to then call themselves &quot;The Chemical Brothers&quot; after &quot;Chemical Beats&quot; (Simons' grandmother had suggested they call themselves &quot;The Grit Brothers&quot;).

In June 1995, they released their fourth single, the first under their new identity. &quot;Leave Home&quot; was released on Junior Boy's Own, as a preview of the imminent debut album and became the band's first chart hit, peaking at No. 17.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Great Rock Discography&quot;/&gt;

=== ''Exit Planet Dust'' and ''Dig Your Own Hole'' (1995–1998) ===
In July 1995, The Chemical Brothers released their debut album ''[[Exit Planet Dust]]'' (the title inspired by their name change) on Freestyle Dust/Junior Boy's Own. It entered the UK charts at No. 9&lt;ref name=&quot;The Great Rock Discography&quot;/&gt; and featured guest vocalist [[Beth Orton]] on the song &quot;Alive Alone&quot;. It eventually went on to sell over a million copies worldwide, and was used on the soundtrack of the [[science fiction]] TV series pilot [[Virtuality (TV series)|Virtuality]]. Shortly after its release, The Chemical Brothers signed to [[Virgin Records]], to which they took their own offshoot label, [[Freestyle Dust]]. For their next single, &quot;[[Life Is Sweet (song)|Life Is Sweet]]&quot;, released in September 1995, they again used a guest vocalist, featuring their friend Tim Burgess, singer of The Charlatans. It reached No. 25 in the UK Singles Chart.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Great Rock Discography&quot;/&gt; The single was also ''Select'' magazine's &quot;Single of the Month&quot; for October. The release included a [[Daft Punk]] remix of &quot;Life Is Sweet&quot;.

[[The Stone Roses]] asked the Chemical Brothers to remix &quot;Begging You&quot;, from their ''[[Second Coming (The Stone Roses album)|Second Coming]]'' album. After beginning work on a remix which they viewed as having potential, The Stone Roses changed their minds and the project was cancelled.

In October 1995, the duo returned to the Heavenly Sunday Social for a second and final run of DJ dates. They then became residents at the Heavenly Social on Saturdays at Turnmills. In November, The Chemical Brothers played the [[Astoria Theatre]] in London. At this time the Brothers usually used a fusion of &quot;Chemical Beats&quot; and [[The Beatles]]' &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot; as their encore. During the encore, however, [[Keith Flint]] from [[The Prodigy]] jumped up on stage to dance, wearing a T-shirt sporting the slogan &quot;Occupation: mad bastard&quot;. A few from the crowd subsequently joined in. This resulted in a power cable being kicked loose, bringing the show to a temporary close. The Chemical Brothers confessed to not being too bothered; &quot;because he's Keith from The Prodigy, and he can do whatever the fucking hell he likes&quot;. Just before Christmas, 1995, they played their biggest gig to date, with The Prodigy, at the [[Brixton Academy]].

In January 1996, ''Exit Planet Dust'' went gold. The Chemical Brothers released their first new material in six months on Virgin, the ''Loops of Fury'' EP. The four-track release was limited to 20,000 copies, but is now available for digital download. It entered the UK charts at No. 13. ''[[NME]]'' described the lead track as &quot;splashing waves of synths across hard-hitting beats&quot;. The EP also contained a Dave Clarke remix of &quot;Chemical Beats&quot;, and two other new tracks, &quot;Get Up on It Like This&quot; and &quot;(The Best Part Of) Breaking Up&quot;.

In February 1996, ''Select'' magazine published a list of the 100 best albums of the 1990s thus far. ''Exit Planet Dust'' was listed at Number 39. In August 1996, The Chemical Brothers supported Oasis at [[Concerts at Knebworth House|Knebworth]], where 125,000 people attended each of the two shows.

During the 1995 [[Glastonbury Festival]], Rowlands and Simons had another conversation with [[Noel Gallagher]]. Gallagher told them how much he liked ''Exit Planet Dust'', and asked if he could sing on a future track, similar to the way [[Tim Burgess (artist)|Tim Burgess]] had worked on &quot;Life Is Sweet&quot;. They did not think much of the offer at the time, given how busy Gallagher would be with the release of Oasis' ''[[(What's the Story) Morning Glory?]]'', plus the complexities of dealing with each other's record companies. However, the duo later worked on a track which they thought would benefit from having a vocal on it. They sent Gallagher a tape of what they had done so far. He worked on it overnight, and left a message with them early the next morning that he was ready to record it. The track was called &quot;[[Setting Sun]]&quot; and was finally released in October 1996. It entered the UK charts at the top, giving the duo their first ever Number One single.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Great Rock Discography&quot;/&gt; &quot;Setting Sun&quot; was backed by a longer instrumental version, and also a new track &quot;Buzz Tracks&quot;, which was not much more than a DJ tool. The three remaining members of [[The Beatles]]' lawyers later wrote to The Chemical Brothers, mistakenly claiming that they had sampled &quot;[[Tomorrow Never Knows]]&quot;. Virgin Records hired a musicologist to prove that they did not sample the classic 1960s [[psychedelic music|psychedelic]] song.

Meanwhile, in 1996, ''[[Live at the Social Volume 1]]'' was released by [[Heavenly Records]], which became The Chemical Brothers' first mix CD (excluding ''Xmas Dust Up'', a free album that came in a 1994 issue of ''NME''). It was also the duo's first and only live album (excluding the EP ''[[Live 05]]'').

In March 1997, the Brothers released the second track from their forthcoming album, to give the world a further taste of what to expect. &quot;[[Block Rockin' Beats]]&quot; went straight to No. 1 in the UK, possibly thanks, this time, to its [[Schoolly D]] vocal sample and re-working of the bassline from [[23 Skidoo (band)|23 Skidoo]]'s single &quot;Coup&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dsng.net/samplesources.htm |title=Sample Sources |work=dsng.net |date= |accessdate=24 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''NME'' named it &quot;Single of the Week&quot; and said &quot;It throbs like your head might if you had just done a length underwater in a swimming pool full of [[Alkyl nitrites|amyl]].&quot; It later won them a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Best Rock Instrumental Performance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.com/nominees/search?artist=&amp;title=&amp;year=1997&amp;genre=31 |title=Grammy Awards : Past Winners Search |publisher=Grammy.com\accessdate=2014-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US at this time, &quot;Setting Sun&quot; was sitting at Number 80 in the Billboard Top 100, after selling around 80,000 copies, an uncommon achievement for a European &quot;dance&quot; act. Sales from ''Exit Planet Dust'' were also around 150,000.

On 7 April 1997 The Chemical Brothers released their second album, ''[[Dig Your Own Hole]]''. It was recorded at the band's own south London studio, with the title taken from graffiti on the wall outside. The album was well received,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/103705/review/5945617/digyourownhole |title=Dig Your Own Hole: The Chemical Brothers: Review |publisher=Rolling Stone |date=3 April 1997 |accessdate=12 May 2009}}{{dead link|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with ''Mixmag'' rating it 10/10 and calling it &quot;mad enough to be thrilling, slick enough for not even remotely trendy coffee tables&quot;.

During the summer of 1997, the Brothers toured extensively, particularly in the United States. They also became residents at [[Tokyo]]'s Liquid Rooms. In August, The Chemical Brothers achieved rapprochement with the US Dust Brothers, and asked them to remix the forthcoming single &quot;[[Elektrobank]]&quot;. They themselves also became highly sought-after for remixes for other artists. In September, the next single from ''Dig Your Own Hole'', &quot;Elektrobank&quot; was released. In November, the pair played at [[Dublin|Dublin's]] Point Theatre, with support from [[Carl Cox]]. They also began a US tour in [[Detroit]].

At the end of the year, ''Dig Your Own Hole''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s final track, the nine minute-long &quot;The Private Psychedelic Reel&quot;, gave rise to a limited-edition mini-EP of the same name. The [[B-side]] consisted of a live version of &quot;Setting Sun&quot;, recorded at the [[A Campingflight to Lowlands Paradise|Lowlands Festival]], Netherlands on 24 August 1997. Also in December, following four sold-out US shows, The Chemical Brothers toured the UK, finishing with a sold-out gig at London's [[Brixton Academy]].

In 1998, they concentrated more on DJ'ing, although some remixes did see the light of day, including &quot;I Think I'm in Love&quot; from [[Spiritualized]]. Both a vocal remix and an instrumental remix were included in the single release. Each clocked in at over seven-and-a-half minutes. Another remix completed by the Brothers was &quot;Delta Sun Bottleneck Stomp&quot; by [[Mercury Rev]]. This was another extension in the association between the two bands, since Mercury Rev's Jonathon Donahue contributed to &quot;The Private Psychedelic Reel&quot; on ''Dig Your Own Hole''.

In September 1998, a second mix album, ''[[Brothers Gonna Work It Out]]'', was released. It contains some of their own tracks and remixes, as well as songs from artists who have influenced their sound, such as [[Renegade Soundwave]], [[Meat Beat Manifesto]], Carlos &quot;After Dark&quot; Berrios, and [[Kenny 'Dope' Gonzales]].

=== ''Surrender'' and ''Come with Us'' (1999–2002) ===
In May 1999, The Chemical Brothers played three UK dates in [[Manchester]], [[Sheffield]] and [[Brighton]], their first since December 1997. Also that month, they released their first new original material in two years, a track called &quot;Hey Boy, Hey Girl&quot;. This was more [[house music|house]]-influenced than hip hop. In interviews at the time, Rowlands and Simons indicated that the track was inspired by nights out at Sheffield club Gatecrasher. The track was also one of their more commercially accessible tracks and went to number 3 in the UK charts.

Their third album, ''[[Surrender (The Chemical Brothers album)|Surrender]]'', was released in June 1999. It featured vocals from Noel Gallagher, Mercury Rev's [[Jonathan Donahue]], and [[Mazzy Star|Mazzy Star's]] [[Hope Sandoval]]. As &quot;Hey Boy, Hey Girl&quot; had suggested, the album was more house-oriented than the previous two. On one of the album's stand out tracks, &quot;Out of Control&quot;, [[New Order|New Order's]] [[Bernard Sumner]] supported by [[Primal Scream|Primal Scream's]] [[Bobby Gillespie]] provided vocals. It reached No. 1 in the UK album charts. The [[Michel Gondry]]-directed [[music video]] for &quot;Let Forever Be&quot;, which utilized ground-breaking video and film effects in its depiction of a young woman's nightmares, also received a lot of attention.

Later that summer, The Brothers performed at the infamous [[Woodstock 99]] concert on 24 July, with positive reception. They later headlined the [[Glastonbury Festival|Glastonbury]] dance tent on the Friday night, followed by a UK tour which ended in December and included [[Homelands (festival)|Homelands]] Scotland on 4 September. In November, &quot;Out of Control&quot;, featuring Sumner and Gillespie on vocals, was released as a single. The release also contained the [[Sasha (DJ)|Sasha]] remix. The final single from ''Surrender'', in February 2000, was the five track &quot;Music: Response&quot; EP, containing the title track and two remixes, plus [[Electronic Battle Weapon]] 4, named &quot;Freak of the Week&quot;, and a track called &quot;Enjoyed&quot;, which was essentially a remix of &quot;Out of Control&quot; by the Brothers themselves.
A CD copy of ''Surrender'' was placed in the third ''[[Blue Peter]]'' [[time capsule]], buried in January 2000. That same month, they appeared on Primal Scream's album ''[[Xtrmntr]]'' at track 11 with a remix.

In June 2000, Tom and Ed played the Pyramid stage at the Glastonbury Festival. In August 2000 they played to a large crowd at the main stage at Creamfields festival, [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. In December 2000, The Chemical Brothers aired one of their new tracks, &quot;It Began in Afrika&quot; at their New York DJ gigs, supporting [[U2]].

In 2001, they were quite active with releases and live performances. Early in the year, they began working on a fourth album, provisionally titled ''Chemical Four''. The first track which fans got a taste of was &quot;It Began in Afrika&quot;, as previously played in their DJ set in New York. The track would make its live debut in [[California]] in April 2001, at the [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]]. Another new track, &quot;Galaxy Bounce&quot;, also got its public debut at Coachella. As had become customary for their releases and experiments, &quot;It Began in Afrika&quot; was first pressed as a promo, as part of the &quot;[[Electronic Battle Weapon]]&quot; series. It received much airplay on dance music radio shows in the UK, and became more and more popular in clubs over the course of the summer. It also became one of the &quot;anthems&quot; in [[Ibiza]] as the summer progressed. It was given a full commercial single release in September, reaching No. 8 in the UK singles chart, even though no promotional video was made for the track.

Rowlands and Simons also remixed a track from [[Fatboy Slim]]'s ''[[Halfway Between the Gutter and the Stars]]'', entitled &quot;Song for Shelter&quot;. This remix was released as a single on 3 September 2001 (one week before &quot;It Began in Afrika&quot;) as the CD2 single for &quot;[[Song for Shelter / Ya Mama]]&quot;. It reached No. 30 in the UK Singles Charts (sales were combined with the CD1 single).

The Chemical Brothers finished work on another album, ''[[Come with Us]]'', in October 2001. It featured collaborations with [[Richard Ashcroft]] of [[The Verve]] (&quot;The Test&quot;), and long-time collaborator [[Beth Orton]] (&quot;The State We're In&quot;). The album was released in January 2002, preceded by a single, &quot;Star Guitar&quot;, a melodic [[Balearic beat]] number, with a promotional video by [[Michel Gondry]] that featured passing scenery synchronized to the beat viewed through a train window. What would be the second track on the album, &quot;It Began in Afrika&quot;, was released 10 September 2001 to be circulated around the clubbing scene where it was a popular hit. &quot;Star Guitar&quot; was also released as a [[DVD]] single, the pair's first. ''Come with Us'', was less well received than their previous albums, but nonetheless went straight to No. 1 in the UK Albums Chart in the first week of its release, selling 100,000 copies. In April, the title track from the album was released as a single with remixes by [[Fatboy Slim]] as part of a double A-sided release with &quot;The Test&quot;.

During the summer of 2002, The Chemical Brothers traveled the festival circuit to promote the album. Later in 2002, they released two EPs, one specifically aimed at Japan and the other the US (entitled ''[[AmericanEP]]''). Both contained remixes, live versions and B-sides. Additionally, the band produced [[New Order]]'s final non-album single &quot;[[Here to Stay (New Order song)|Here to Stay]]&quot;, and remixed the song as well.
One of their other major songs from this album was &quot;Galaxy Bounce&quot;, which was popular and featured as the main title music for the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] game ''[[Project Gotham Racing]]''. It was also included on the soundtrack for the movie ''[[Lara Croft: Tomb Raider]]''. &quot;Star Guitar&quot; was featured as a song on the [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]]'s ''[[Lumines II]]''.

Two other songs, &quot;Come with Us (Introduction)&quot; and &quot;Star Guitar (Title Screen)&quot;, were featured on a ''[[PlayStation 2]]'' racing game titled ''WRC II: Extreme''. Both songs are instrumental.
The Song ''My Elastic Eye'' from the ''Come with Us'' album was played in the 2004 movie ''[[The Butterfly Effect]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0289879/soundtrack |title=The Butterfly Effect (2004) – Soundtracks |work=Imdb.com |accessdate=24 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; starring [[Ashton Kutcher]] and [[Amy Smart]].

=== ''Push the Button'' (2002–2006) ===
Late 2002 and early 2003 saw Rowlands and Simons back in the studio working on new material, including &quot;The Golden Path&quot;, a collaboration with [[Wayne Coyne]], the lead singer of [[The Flaming Lips]]. This was released in September 2003, at the same time as a &quot;best of&quot; album, entitled ''[[Singles 93–03]]'', marking ten years of The Chemical Brothers' releases. ''Singles 93–03'' included most, but not all, of their singles. A second new track, in addition to &quot;The Golden Path&quot;, was included on the album, called &quot;Get Yourself High&quot;. ''Singles 93–03'' was also released on DVD, with extra features including selected live performances and interviews with Rowlands, Simons, and many of their collaborators from throughout the period. &quot;Get Yourself High&quot;, which featured Canadian rapper [[k-os]] on vocals, was released as a single in November 2003.

In late 2003 and 2004, The Chemical Brothers continued to work in the studio on new material and a remix of &quot;[[Slow (song)|Slow]]&quot; by [[Kylie Minogue]]. After being released on rare white label vinyl, it was subsequently given a commercial release in March on CD (on her next single &quot;Red Blooded Woman&quot;) and on exclusive 12&quot; vinyl picture disc (containing two other Kylie remixes). In Summer 2004 they returned to the festival circuit, including appearances at the [[Glastonbury Festival]], Tokyo, Scotland, and Ireland. They also visited [[South America]] for the second time (the first time being in 1999), arriving at [[Chile]], [[Argentina]], and [[Brazil]]. It was during these sets that they played new material, including &quot;Acid Children&quot;, which proved to be one of the most popular new tracks.

In September 2004, The Chemical Brothers released the seventh &quot;Electronic Battle Weapon&quot;. &quot;Electronic Battle Weapon 7&quot; was being released as a one-sided promo-only 12&quot;, containing &quot;Acid Children&quot;. A marked departure from the Chemical Brothers' previous musical endeavours, it featured a screeching 303 bassline and a distinctive vocal sample; a pitch-altered vocal sample proclaiming &quot;You Are All My Children Now!&quot;, which is lifted from the horror film ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge]]''. It was coupled with the projection of a sinister clown mouthing these same words at their live gigs.

The Electronic Battle Weapon series of promo releases have typically been newly recorded Chemical Brothers tracks, released on promo to allow DJs to test them in a club environment, and to gauge their popularity.

In 2004, The Chemical Brothers began work on ''[[Push the Button (The Chemical Brothers album)|Push the Button]]'', their fifth studio album, which features collaborations with [[Tim Burgess (artist)|Tim Burgess]], [[Kele Okereke]], and [[Anwar Superstar]], amongst others. The album was released on 24 January 2005.

&quot;[[Galvanize (song)|Galvanize]]&quot;, which features rapper [[Q-Tip (rapper)|Q-Tip]] on vocals, was the first single to be taken from ''Push the Button'', and premiered exclusively on [[iTunes]]. The single was released on 17 January 2005, and entered the UK chart at No. 3. The second single, &quot;[[Believe (Chemical Brothers song)|Believe]]&quot; (featuring Kele Okereke from [[Bloc Party]]), failed to crack the top 10, but still made it into the top 20, peaking at No. 18. &quot;The Boxer&quot;, featuring Tim Burgess, became the duo's first single to fail to crack the top 40.

The album and single &quot;Galvanize&quot; won a Grammy at the [[Grammy Awards of 2006]]. One of the songs in this album, &quot;The Big Jump&quot;, appears in the video game ''[[Burnout Revenge]]'', as well as ''[[Project Gotham Racing 3]]''. The track &quot;Surface to Air&quot; features a pulsing chord progression and bassline reminiscent of the intro to the [[The Strokes|Strokes]] song &quot;The Modern Age&quot;.{{or|date=September 2011}}

An unofficial, remixed version of the album entitled ''Flip the Switch'' was released as a free download, along with the ''Believe'' EP, featuring six further remixes of &quot;Believe&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chems.musicremixed.org/main.html |title=Flip The Switch – The Chemical Brothers remixed |accessdate=13 September 2009}}{{dead link|date=September 2011}} {{dead link|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2006, The Chemical Brothers were revealed as the first musicians to be involved in [[Tate Tracks]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Moss&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culture24.org.uk/art/art39863|title=Tate Modern Makes Music With Chemical Brothers For Tate Tracks Project|last=Moss|first=Richard|date=31 August 2006|work=[[Culture24]]|accessdate=9 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TateTracks&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tatetracks.org.uk|title=Tate Tracks|year=2006|publisher=[[Tate]]|accessdate=9 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tate Modern]] invited various groups and songwriters to choose a work that inspired them from the gallery's collection of modern art and then write a track about it. The Chemical Brothers' submission, ''Rock Drill'', was inspired by the [[Jacob Epstein]] sculpture ''[[Rock Drill (Jacob Epstein)|Torso in Metal from The Rock Drill]]'', and could&lt;!-- is this still the case? --&gt; be heard on headphones in front of the work in the gallery.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moss&quot; /&gt; From October 2006, it also became available to hear online at the Tate Tracks website.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moss&quot; /&gt;

=== ''We Are the Night'' (2007–2009) ===
The Brothers announced in June 2006 on their official web forum that the duo had been working on fresh material, specifically an album, codenamed &quot;Chemical 6&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forums.thechemicalbrothers.com/viewtopic.php?t=4259 Chemical Brothers New Material] – The Chemical Brothers Official Site{{dead link|date=September 2011}} {{dead link|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simons also wrote that the band would be playing select venues in the Summer 2007 season, specifying Rome, and also [[Fabric (club)|Fabric]] in London. Simons is also quoted as saying that the duo are &quot;hoping to put a battle weapon out for the summer&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Simons | first = Ed | title = Post at the official forum | url=http://www.thechemicalbrothers.com/forum/topic.php?id=4259 | accessdate = 12 July 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071103084622/http://www.thechemicalbrothers.com/forum/topic.php?id=4259 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 3 November 2007}}{{dead link|date=September 2011}} {{dead link|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; possibly referring to the Electronic Battle Weapon series, the somewhat experimental tracks the band occasionally release on [[white label]].

Electronic Battle Weapons 8 &amp; 9 were debuted on [[Pete Tong]]'s [[BBC Radio 1]] show on 8 December 2006. The double sided vinyl was finally released just before The Chemical Brother's much anticipated New Year's Eve gig at the famous [[Turnmills]] in London. The vinyl had a limited edition release worldwide and has been received well by fans, DJs, and critics alike. Electronic Battle Weapon 8, at about six and a half minutes, is very distinct from the &quot;big acid&quot; style that the earlier Battle Weapons adhered to. It is characterised by 'thundering' drums with a rising [[synth line]]. A version of this track features on the ''We Are the Night'' album and is entitled &quot;Saturate&quot;. &quot;Electronic Battle Weapon 9&quot; is a typical Chemicals dancefloor track with their trademark [[vocoder]] vocals coupled with sirens and a basic 'tribal' melody.

At the same [[Turnmills]] gig, the Brothers also played a previously unreleased song at midnight to welcome 2007, which went down well with the crowd. This track eventually emerged as &quot;Burst Generator&quot;, found on the forthcoming album ''We Are the Night''. Many were left wondering if the latest in the Electronic Battle Weapon series were simply one off experiments or signal a new direction they could take with the new album, perhaps swaying from their genre defining big beat albums of the past. The song was also the band's 100th released song.

On 21 March 2007, The Chemical Brothers officially announced their forthcoming album on [[MySpace]]. The new album, entitled ''[[We Are the Night]]'', was released on 2 July 2007 in the United Kingdom and 17 July 2007 in the United States. The Chemical Brothers cited a delay in the production of artwork for this delay.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thechemicalbrothers.com/home/ Album release date announced] – The Chemical Brothers Official Website{{dead link|date=September 2011}} {{dead link|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; EMI subsequently released an online Chemical Brothers computer game as an apology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=23169_0_2_0_C |title=New album The Chemical Brothers delayed - here's a 'sorry guys' |date=18 May 2007 |work=side-line.com |accessdate=24 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The track listing was released to the fans on the official mailing list on 10 April. The new album is heavily collaborated, with the likes of [[Klaxons]] (&quot;All Rights Reversed&quot;), [[Midlake]] (&quot;The Pills Won't Help You Now&quot;), [[Ali Love]] (&quot;[[Do It Again (The Chemical Brothers song)|Do It Again]]&quot;), and [[Willy Mason]] (&quot;Battle Scars&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=22186_0_2_0_C |title=The Chemical Brothers launch details new album |work=side-line.com |date=12 April 2007 |accessdate=24 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 April 2007, [[Pete Tong]] again had the privilege of giving the world the very first preview of a Chemicals track. This time it was the first single &quot;Do It Again&quot; off their new album, aired on his [[BBC Radio 1]] &quot;[[In New Music We Trust]]&quot; show. The official release of the single was 4 June (digital download) and 14 June (12&quot;, 7&quot;, and CD). The album went on general release in the UK on 2 July 2007.

In September 2007, The Chemical Brothers played a free live gig in Trafalgar Square as part of the Becks Fusions event. All who attended were provided with 3D glasses to view the on-screen visual effects.

In 2008, The Chemical Brothers' music was featured in a [[Ecstasy (2007 film)|movie adaption]] of [[Irvine Welsh|Irvine Welsh's]] best-selling novel ''[[Ecstasy: Three Tales of Chemical Romance]]''.

The Chemical Brothers supplied a new track for the ''[[Heroes (TV series)|Heroes]]'' soundtrack, titled &quot;Keep My Composure&quot;.

===''Further'', ''Hanna'', ''Don't Think'' and ''Black Swan'' (2010–present)===
On 30 March 2010, the band announced on their website that their seventh studio album, titled ''[[Further (The Chemical Brothers album)|Further]]'', would be released on 22 June and would be &quot;the band's first to be released with corresponding films made specifically to match each of the 8 audio tracks.&quot; The films were made with long-time visuals collaborators Adam Smith and Marcus Lyall. The album was described as their most &quot;psychedelic and melodic to date&quot;.{{by whom|date=September 2011}} Before the release of the album, the band played four shows in May at the London Roundhouse where they played the album and its accompanying films in their entirety. The films featured on a special edition DVD and on the iTunes LP edition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thechemicalbrothers.com/#/news/article/92/further Further – the new album released 7 June on Freestyle Dust / Parlophone Records], thechemicalbrothers.com{{dead link|date=September 2011}} {{dead link|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most reviews have been positive, with [[BBC Music]] declaring that &quot;...&amp;nbsp;synths are brutally manhandled and pushed to their limits across the eight tracks&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/6d28 |title=Review of The Chemical Brothers - Further |author=Ian Wade |date=7 June 2010 |work=BBC Music |accessdate=24 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Irish Times]]'' reported that &quot;This is a very impressive collection that is carried along with a stirring sense of velocity and momentum&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/theticket/2010/0528/1224271267605.html Chemical Brothers – The Irish Times – Fri, 28 May 2010].

At the [[New York Comic Con]], on 10 October 2010, English film director [[Joe Wright]] announced that The Chemical Brothers would be scoring the soundtrack to his upcoming film, ''[[Hanna (film)|Hanna]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://filmonic.com/the-chemical-brothers-will-score-hanna#.Tn0J9-ysOSo |title=The Chemical Brothers will score Hanna |date=9 October 2010 |work=Filmonic |accessdate=24 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wright, who had worked with The Chemical Brothers in the past as a member of the visual company Vegetable Vision, stated that he was &quot;very excited to finally&amp;nbsp;... work with a more modern beat. There's a lot of bass, it's very loud.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theplaylist.blogspot.com/2010/10/chemical-brothers-to-score-joe-wrights.html |title=The Chemical Brothers To Score Joe Wright's Teenage Assassin Film, 'Hanna' |date=10 September 2010 |work=theplaylist.blogspot.com |accessdate=24 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The soundtrack was released exclusively on iTunes on 15 March 2011 and on CD on 4 July 2011.

Two weeks after the announcement regarding ''Hanna'', rumors began circulating that The Chemical Brothers had recorded part of the score for the movie ''[[Black Swan (film)|Black Swan]]'', after a post in Ed Simon's [[Twitter]] account. A second post on the Chemical Brothers' own Twitter account seemed to confirm this. On 22 November 2010, a ''Black Swan'' music video was released along with the movie trailer. This featured a different version of the track &quot;[[Further (The Chemical Brothers album)|Don't Think]]&quot; and announced that the movie would feature new music from The Chemical Brothers, along with a handful of other artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/fox_searchlight/blackswan/ |title=Black Swan |work=apple.com |accessdate=24 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, the names of the eight tracks not composed by [[Clint Mansell]] – ''Black Swan'''s main composer – were released, listing The Chemical Brothers as contributing three new songs for the movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/archives/2010/11/23/black_swan_features_3_new_songs_by_the_chemicals_brothers_new_tracks_by_pet |title='Black Swan' Features 3 New Songs By The Chemicals Brothers, New Tracks By Pete Min, Jakes &amp; More |author=Keith Jagernauth |date=23 November 2010 |work=indiewire.com |accessdate=24 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 November, an exclusive video was posted on [[Rolling Stone|RollingStone.com]], containing more footage of the alternate version of &quot;Don't Think&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/exclusive-video-natalie-portman-explores-her-dark-side-in-black-swan-clip-20101129 |title=Exclusive Video: Natalie Portman Explores Her Dark Side in 'Black Swan' Clip |date=29 November 2010 |work=rollingstone.com |accessdate=24 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mansell's work was released the next day. No announcement has been made yet on whether the original tracks not by Mansell would be given a release or not.

On 7 March 2012, it was announced that The Chemical Brothers would be scoring their second movie soundtrack, for the bank heist film ''[[Now You See Me (film)|Now You See Me]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/exclusive-the-chemical-brothers-to-score-louis-leterriers-now-you-see-me |title=The Chemical Brothers To Score Louis Leterrier's 'Now You See Me' &amp;#124; The Playlist |publisher=Blogs.indiewire.com |date= |accessdate=11 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this was later denied by Tom Rowlands, who stated that the band was in talks at an early stage, but had to pull out of the project due to scheduling conflicts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Post by syrinx (alias of Tom Rowlands) on The Chemical Brothers Forum&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forum.thechemicalbrothers.com/index.php?/topic/9121-now-you-see-me/ |title=Now You See Me! |publisher=TheChemicalBrothers.com |date= |accessdate=11 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Live ==
The Chemical Brothers are credited as being one of the few truly arena-sized electronic acts. Their live acts comprise large screens displaying [[psychedelic]] images, [[strobe lights]], and [[laser]]s that project over the crowd.There has been speculation over how much of their live gigs are pre-recorded, although they insist (on their official website FAQ) that they have a mere outline of track order and the rest is mixed live. This would seem to be confirmed by concertgoers who have seen gigs on consecutive nights and have posted notable differences between the sets played.

The Brothers have also played at many major festivals, including [[Glastonbury Festival|Glastonbury]], [[Fuji Rock Festival|Fuji Rock]], [[Reading Festival|Reading]], the [[HFStival]], and [[Leeds Festival|Leeds]] festival. They currently hold the record for most gigs performed in a year at the [[Brixton Academy]]. The Chems have infamously, despite their high status in the mainstream, never appeared on [[Top of the Pops]], with the use of music videos to replace the performance, sometimes accompanied by a video apologising for their absence. In 1999, a live US tour video of &quot;Hey Boy, Hey Girl&quot; was shown, even though the song was not in the top 40 at the time, and also released other singles before then at the time.

In addition to performing their own music, they also hold regular DJ nights where they mix other artist's tracks (in the style of ''Brothers Gonna Work It Out'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Alexis Petridis |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2002/jan/25/shopping.popandrock |title=Interview: The Chemical Brothers &amp;#124; Music |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2014-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with their recorded albums, The Chemical Brothers are well known for their incorporation of guest vocalists into their live performances. Notable appearances in recent gigs have included [[Bernard Sumner]] of [[New Order]], who sang on the original &quot;Out of Control&quot;, [[Wayne Coyne]] of [[The Flaming Lips]], and [[Tim Burgess (artist)|Tim Burgess]].

== Logo ==
The typeface used to write the typical &quot;The Chemical Brothers&quot; logo is derived from Sho,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linotype.com/1473/sho-family.html|title=&quot;Sho&quot; typeface font|publisher=Linotype.com|accessdate=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; designed by [[Karlgeorg Hoefer]] in 1992. The Chemical Brothers' original logo differs only in a few details from orthodox Sho, e.g. in the letters a and b. [[Mergenthaler Linotype Company]] holds the licence for this typeface.

It is an [[Ecclesiology|ecclesiastical]]&lt;ref name=&quot;factbook&quot;/&gt; or [[Sacerdotal state|sacerdotal]]-[[Monarchy|monarchical]]&lt;ref name=pages&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic-pages.com/vatican/vatican_city.asp |title=Vatican City |publisher=Catholic-Pages.com |accessdate=12 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; state ruled by the Bishop of [[diocese of Rome|Rome]]—the [[Pope]]. The highest state functionaries are all [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] clergy of various national origins. Since the return of the Popes from [[Avignon Papacy|Avignon]] in 1377, they have generally resided at the [[Apostolic Palace]] within what is now Vatican City, although at times residing instead in the [[Quirinal Palace]] in Rome or elsewhere.

Vatican City is distinct from the [[Holy See]] ({{lang-la|Sancta Sedes}}),&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;The Holy See is the central governing body of the Catholic Church and a sovereign entity recognized by international law, consisting of the Pope and the [[Roman Curia]]. It is also commonly referred to as &quot;the Vatican&quot;, especially when used as a [[metonym]] for the [[hierarchy of the Catholic Church]].&lt;/ref&gt; which dates back to [[early Christianity]] and is the main [[episcopal see]] of 1.2&amp;nbsp;billion [[Latin Church|Latin]] and [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Catholic]] adherents around the globe. The independent city-state, on the other hand, came into existence in 1929 by the [[Lateran Treaty]] between the Holy See and Italy, which spoke of it as a new creation,&lt;ref name=Preamble /&gt; not as a vestige of the much larger [[Papal States]] (756–1870), which had previously encompassed much of central Italy. According to the terms of the treaty, the Holy See has &quot;full ownership, exclusive dominion, and sovereign authority and jurisdiction&quot; over the city-state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aloha.net/~mikesch/treaty.htm Article 3 of the [[Lateran Treaty]].]&lt;/ref&gt;

Within Vatican City are cultural sites such as [[St. Peter's Basilica]], the [[Sistine Chapel]] and the [[Vatican Museums]]. They feature some of the world's most famous paintings and sculptures. The unique [[economy of Vatican City]] is supported financially by the sale of postage stamps and tourist mementos, fees for admission to museums, and the sale of publications.

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Vatican City}}
[[File:VaticanCity Annex.jpg|left|thumb|Territory of Vatican City State according to the [[Lateran Treaty]]]]
The name &quot;Vatican&quot; predates Christianity and comes from the Latin ''{{lang|la|[[Vatican Hill|Mons Vaticanus]]}}'', meaning Vatican Mount.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Vatican|title=Vatican (search)|publisher=Online Dictionary|accessdate=28 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The territory of Vatican City is part of the ''Mons Vaticanus'', and of the adjacent former Vatican Fields. It is in this territory that [[St. Peter's Basilica]], the [[Apostolic Palace]], the [[Sistine Chapel]], and museums were built, along with various other buildings. The area was part of the Roman ''[[rione]]'' of [[borgo (rione of Rome)|Borgo]] until 1929. Being separated from the city, on the west bank of the [[Tiber River|Tiber]] river, the area was an outcrop of the city that was protected by being included within the walls of [[Pope Leo IV|Leo IV]] (847–55), and later expanded by the current fortification walls, built under [[Pope Paul III|Paul III]] (1534–49), [[Pope Pius IV|Pius IV]] (1559–65) and [[Pope Urban VIII|Urban VIII]] (1623–44).

When the [[Lateran Treaty]] of 1929 that gave the state its form was being prepared, the boundaries of the proposed territory were influenced by the fact that much of it was all but enclosed by this loop. For some tracts of the frontier, there was no wall, but the line of certain buildings supplied part of the boundary, and for a small part of the frontier a modern wall was constructed.

The territory includes [[Saint Peter's Square|St. Peter's Square]], distinguished from the territory of Italy only by a white line along the limit of the square, where it touches Piazza Pio&amp;nbsp;XII. St. Peter's Square is reached through the [[Via della Conciliazione]] which runs from close to the Tiber River to St. Peter's. This grand approach was constructed by [[Benito Mussolini]] after the conclusion of the Lateran Treaty.
 
According to the Lateran Treaty, certain [[properties of the Holy See]] that are located in Italian territory, most notably the [[Papal Palace of Castel Gandolfo]] and the [[Papal basilica|major basilicas]], enjoy extraterritorial status similar to that of foreign [[diplomatic mission|embassies]].&lt;ref name=&quot;treaty&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;treaty text&quot;/&gt; These properties, scattered all over Rome and Italy, house essential offices and institutions necessary to the character and mission of the Holy See.&lt;ref name=&quot;treaty text&quot;&gt;Lateran Treaty of 1929, Articles 13–16&lt;/ref&gt;

Castel Gandolfo and the named basilicas are patrolled internally by [[Corps of Gendarmerie of Vatican City|police agents of Vatican City State]] and not by [[Law enforcement in Italy|Italian police]]. According to the Lateran Treaty (Art. 3) St. Peter's Square, up to but not including the steps leading to the basilica, is normally patrolled by the Italian police.&lt;ref name='treaty'&gt;{{cite web|title=Patti Lateranensi|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/secretariat_state/archivio/documents/rc_seg-st_19290211_patti-lateranensi_it.html|publisher=vatican.va|accessdate=6 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are no passport controls for visitors entering Vatican City from the surrounding Italian territory. There is free public access to Saint Peter's Square and Basilica and, on the occasion of papal general audiences, to the hall in which they are held. For these audiences and for major ceremonies in Saint Peter's Basilica and Square, tickets free of charge must be obtained beforehand. The Vatican Museums, incorporating the Sistine Chapel, usually charge an entrance fee. There is no general public access to the gardens, but guided tours for small groups can be arranged to the gardens and excavations under the basilica. Other places are open only to individuals who have business to transact there.

===Climate===

Vatican City's climate is the same as Rome's: a temperate, [[Mediterranean climate]] with mild, rainy winters from September to mid-May and hot, dry summers from May to August. Some minor local features, principally mists and dews, are caused by the anomalous bulk of St Peter's Basilica, the elevation, the fountains and the size of the large paved square.

===Gardens===
{{Main|Gardens of Vatican City}}

Within the territory of Vatican City are the [[Gardens of Vatican City|Vatican Gardens]] ({{lang-it|Giardini Vaticani}}),&lt;ref name=&quot;VaticanMap&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saintpetersbasilica.org/vaticancity-map.htm |title=Map of Vatican City |publisher=www.saintpetersbasilica.org |accessdate=11 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; which account for more than half of this territory. The gardens, established during the [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]] era, are decorated with fountains and sculptures.

The gardens cover approximately {{convert|23|ha|acres}} which is most of the [[Vatican Hill]]. The highest point is {{convert|60|m}} [[above mean sea level]]. Stone walls bound the area in the North, South and West.

The gardens date back to medieval times when orchards and vineyards extended to the north of the Papal [[Apostolic Palace]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Pellegrino&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pellegrinocattolico.com/ctv/gardens.htm|title=Al Pellegrino Cattolico: ''The Vatican Gardens''|accessdate=21 November 2008 |publisher=2008 Al Pellegrino Cattolico s.r.l.

===Early history===
{{See also|Vatican Hill}}
[[File:Vatican Piazza San Pietro Obelisk slim.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The Vatican [[obelisk]] was originally taken from Egypt by [[Caligula]].]]
The name &quot;Vatican&quot; was already in use in the time of the [[Roman Republic]] for a marshy area on the west bank of the Tiber across from the city of Rome. Under the [[Roman Empire]], many villas were constructed there, after [[Agrippina the Elder]] (14 BC&amp;nbsp;– 18 October AD 33) drained the area and laid out her gardens in the early 1st century AD. In AD 40, her son, Emperor [[Caligula]] (31 August AD 12–24 January AD 41; r. 37–41) built in her gardens a circus for charioteers (AD 40) that was later completed by Nero, the ''Circus Gaii et Neronis'',&lt;ref&gt;Lanciani, Rodolfo (1892). [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Europe/Italy/Lazio/Roma/Rome/_Texts/Lanciani/LANPAC/3*.html#sec16 Pagan and Christian Rome] Houghton, Mifflin.&lt;/ref&gt; usually called, simply, the [[Circus of Nero]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vaticanstate.va/content/vaticanstate/en/stato-e-governo/storia/la-citta-del-vaticano-nel-tempo.html Vatican City in the Past]&lt;/ref&gt;

Even before the arrival of Christianity, it is supposed that this originally uninhabited part of Rome (the ''ager vaticanus'') had long been considered sacred, or at least not available for habitation.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} A shrine dedicated to the Phrygian goddess [[Cybele]] and her consort [[Attis]] remained active long after the [[Constantinian Basilica of St. Peter]] was built nearby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Altar dedicated to Cybele and Attis|url=http://mv.vatican.va/3_EN/pages/x-Schede/MGEs/MGEs_Sala16_03_040.html|publisher=Vatican Museums|accessdate=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The particularly low quality of Vatican wine, even after the reclamation of the area, was commented on by the poet [[Martial]] (40 – between 102 and 104 AD).&lt;ref&gt;[https://mospace.umsystem.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10355/8100/research.pdf?sequence=3 Damien Martin, &quot;Wine and Drunkenness in Roman Society&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; In AD 69, the [[Year of the Four Emperors]], when the northern army that brought [[Aulus Vitellius]] to power arrived in Rome, &quot;a large proportion camped in the unhealthy districts of the Vatican, which resulted in many deaths among the common soldiery; and the Tiber being close by, the inability of the Gauls and Germans to bear the heat and the consequent greed with which they drank from the stream weakened their bodies, which were already an easy prey to disease&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''The Histories'', II, 93, translation by Clifford H. Moore (The Loeb Classical Library, first printed 1925)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Vatican Obelisk]] was originally taken by [[Caligula]] from [[Heliopolis (ancient)|Heliopolis]], Egypt to decorate the ''spina'' of his circus and is thus its last visible remnant.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Elder]], [[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]] XVI.76.&lt;/ref&gt; This area became the site of martyrdom of many Christians after the [[Great Fire of Rome]] in AD 64. Ancient tradition holds that it was in this circus that [[Saint Peter]] was [[Cross of St. Peter|crucified upside-down]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=St. Peter, Prince of the Apostles|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11744a.htm#IV|publisher=Catholic Encyclopedia|accessdate=12 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposite the circus was a cemetery separated by the [[Via Cornelia]]. Funeral monuments and mausoleums and small tombs as well as altars to pagan gods of all kinds of polytheistic religions were constructed lasting until before the construction of the Constantinian Basilica of St. Peter's in the first half of the 4th century. Remains of this ancient [[list of necropoleis|necropolis]] were brought to light sporadically during renovations by various popes throughout the centuries increasing in frequency during the [[Renaissance]] until it was systematically excavated by orders of [[Pope Pius XII]] from 1939 to 1941. The Constantinian basilica was built in 326 over what was believed to be the [[Saint Peter's tomb|tomb of Saint Peter]], buried in that cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=37b9V9IXDsYC&amp;pg=PA126&amp;dq=Gardner+%22reputed+grave%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=A3gQUqPdOYWThgeirYCgDg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Gardner%20%22reputed%20grave%22&amp;f=false Fred S. Kleiner, ''Gardner's Art through the Ages'' (Cengage Learning 2012 ISBN 978-1-13395479-8), p. 126]&lt;/ref&gt;

From then on, the area became more populated in connection with activity at the basilica. A palace was constructed nearby as early as the 5th century during the pontificate of [[Pope Symmachus]] (reigned 498–514).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/65/va/Vatican.html Columbia Encyclopedia]{{dead link|date=October 2010}}, Sixth Edition, 2001–2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===Papal States===
{{Main|Papal States}}
{{See also|History of the Papacy}}
[[File:Italy 1796.png|thumb|left|upright|The Italian peninsula in 1796. The shaded yellow territory in central Italy is the Papal State.]]
Popes gradually came to have a secular role as governors of regions near Rome. They ruled the [[Papal States]], which covered a large portion of the Italian peninsula, for more than a thousand years until the mid-19th century, when all the territory belonging to the papacy was seized by the [[Italian unification|newly created]] Kingdom of Italy.

For most of this time the popes did not live at the Vatican. The [[Lateran Palace]], on the opposite side of Rome was their habitual residence for about a thousand years. From 1309 to 1377, they lived at [[Avignon]] in France. On their return to Rome they chose to live at the Vatican. They moved to the [[Quirinal Palace]] after work on it was completed under [[Pope Paul V]] (1605–1621), but on the [[capture of Rome]] in 1870 retired to the Vatican, and what had been their residence became that of the [[Kingdom of Italy|King of Italy]].

===Italian unification===
{{main|Roman Question}}
In 1870, the Pope's holdings were left in an uncertain situation when Rome itself was annexed by the [[Piedmont]]-led forces which had [[Italian unification|united the rest of Italy]], after a nominal resistance by the papal forces. Between 1861 and 1929 the status of the Pope was referred to as the &quot;Roman Question&quot;.

Italy made no attempt to interfere with the Holy See within the Vatican walls. However, they confiscated church property in many places. In 1871, the [[Palazzo Quirinale]], the Papal palace since 1583, was confiscated by the king of Italy and became the royal palace. Thereafter the popes resided undisturbed within the Vatican walls, and certain papal prerogatives were recognized by the [[Law of Guarantees]], including the right to send and receive ambassadors. But the Popes did not recognise the Italian king's right to rule in Rome, and they [[prisoner in the Vatican|refused to leave the Vatican compound]] until the dispute was resolved in 1929; [[Pope Pius IX]] (1846–78), the last ruler of the Papal States, was referred to as a &quot;[[prisoner in the Vatican]]&quot;. Forced to give up secular power, the popes focused on spiritual issues.&lt;ref name=&quot;World History&quot;&gt;Wetterau, Bruce. World history. New York: Henry Holt &amp; co. 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lateran treaties===
{{main|Lateran Treaty}}
This situation was resolved on 11 February 1929, when the Lateran Treaty between the Holy See and the Kingdom of Italy was signed by [[Prime Minister of Italy|Prime Minister and Head of Government]] [[Benito Mussolini]] on behalf of King [[Victor Emmanuel III]] and by [[Cardinal Secretary of State]] [[Pietro Gasparri]] for [[Pope Pius XI]].&lt;ref name=Preamble&gt;[http://www.vaticanstate.va/content/dam/vaticanstate/documenti/leggi-e-decreti/Normative-Penali-e-Amministrative/LateranTreaty.pdf Preamble of the Lateran Treaty]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aloha.net/~mikesch/treaty.htm Lateran Pacts of 1929]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/secretariat_state/archivio/documents/rc_seg-st_19290211_patti-lateranensi_it.html#TRATTATO_FRA_LA_SANTA_SEDE_E_L’ITALIA Trattato fra la Santa Sede e l'Italia]&lt;/ref&gt; The treaty, which became effective on 7 June 1929, established the independent state of Vatican City and reaffirmed the special status of Catholicism in Italy.&lt;ref name=Statute&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/secretariat_state/archivio/documents/rc_seg-st_19290211_patti-lateranensi_it.html Lateran Treaty, article 1: &quot;L'Italia riconosce e riafferma il principio consacrato nell’articolo 1° dello Statuto del Regno 4 marzo 1848, pel quale la religione cattolica, apostolica e romana è la sola religione dello Stato.&quot; (Italy recognizes and re-affirms the principle consecrated in Article 1 of the Statute of the Kingdom 4 March 1848, by which the Catholic, Apostolic and Roman Religion is the sole religion of the State.)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II===
{{main|Vatican City during World War II}}
[[File:The British Army in Italy 1944 NA16179.jpg|thumb|The band of the [[38th (Irish) Infantry Brigade|Irish Brigade]] plays in front of St Peter's Basilica, June 1944]]
The Holy See, which ruled Vatican City, pursued a policy of neutrality during [[World War II]], under the leadership of [[Pope Pius XII]]. Although German troops occupied the city of Rome after the September 1943 [[Armistice of Cassibile]], and the Allies from 1944, they respected Vatican City as neutral territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005446 |title=Rome |publisher=Ushmm.org |date= |accessdate=2013-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main diplomatic priorities of the [[bishop of Rome]] was to prevent the bombing of the city; so sensitive was the pontiff that he protested even the British air dropping of pamphlets over Rome, claiming that the few landing within the city-state violated the Vatican's neutrality.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chadwick1&quot;&gt;Chadwick, 1988, pp. 222–32&lt;/ref&gt; The British policy, as expressed in the minutes of a Cabinet meeting, was: &quot;that we should on no account molest the Vatican City, but that our action as regards the rest of Rome would depend upon how far the Italian government observed the rules of war&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chadwick1&quot;/&gt;

After the American entry into the war, the US opposed such a bombing, fearful of offending Catholic members of its military forces, but said that &quot;they could not stop the British from bombing Rome if the British so decided&quot;. The British uncompromisingly said &quot;they would bomb Rome whenever the needs of the war demanded&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Chadwick, 1988, pp. 232–36&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1942, the British envoy suggested to the Holy See that Rome be declared an &quot;[[open city]]&quot;, a suggestion that the Holy See took more seriously than was probably meant by the British, who did not want Rome to be an open city, but Mussolini rejected the suggestion when the Holy See put it to him. In connection with the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]], 500 American aircraft [[Bombing of Rome in World War II|bombed Rome on 19 July 1943]], aiming particularly at the railway hub. Some 1,500 people were killed, and Pius XII himself, who had been described in the previous month as &quot;worried sick&quot; about the possible bombing, went to the scene of the tragedy. Another raid took place on 13 August 1943, after Mussolini had been ousted from power.&lt;ref&gt;Chadwick, 1988, pp. 236–44&lt;/ref&gt; On the following day, the new government declared Rome an open city, after consulting the Holy See on the wording of the declaration, but the British had decided that they would never recognize Rome as an open city.&lt;ref&gt;Chadwick, 1988, pp. 244–45&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-war history===
Pius XII had refrained from creating [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]] during the war. By the end of World War II there were several prominent vacancies: [[Cardinal Secretary of State]], [[Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church|Camerlengo]], [[Chancellor of the Holy Roman Church|Chancellor]], and Prefect for the [[Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life|Congregation for the Religious]] among them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chadwick|1988|p=304}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pius XII [[Cardinals created by Pope Pius XII in 1946|created 32 cardinals in early 1946]], having announced his intentions to do so in his preceding Christmas message.

The [[Military in Vatican City|Pontifical Military Corps]], except for the [[Swiss Guard]], was disbanded by will of [[Pope Paul VI|Paul VI]], as expressed in a letter of 14 September 1970.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vatican State&quot; /&gt; The [[Corps of Gendarmerie of Vatican City|Gendarmerie Corps]] was transformed into a civilian [[police]] and security force.

In 1984, a new [[concordat]] between the Holy See and Italy modified certain provisions of the earlier treaty, including the position of Catholicism as the Italian state religion, a position given to it by a statute of 1848.&lt;ref name=Statute/&gt;

Construction in 1995 of a new guest house, [[Domus Sanctae Marthae]], adjacent to St Peter's Basilica was criticised by Italian environmental groups, backed by Italian politicians. They claimed the new building would block views of the Basilica from nearby Italian apartments.&lt;ref name=&quot;guest house&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Thavis|first=John|title=The Vatican Diaries: A Behind-the-Scenes Look at the Power, Personalities and Politics at the Heart of the Catholic Church|year=2013|publisher=Viking|location=NY |isbn=978-0-670-02671-5 |pages=121–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a short while the plans strained the relations between the Vatican and the Italian government. The head of the Vatican's Department of Technical Services robustly rejected challenges to the Vatican State's right to build within its borders.&lt;ref name=&quot;guest house&quot; /&gt;

==Governance==
&lt;!-- Please add new information into relevant articles of the series --&gt;
{{Politics of Vatican City|Government of Vatican City}}
{{Main|Politics of Vatican City}}
The politics of Vatican City takes place in an [[absolute monarchy|absolute]] [[elective monarchy]], in which the head of the Roman Catholic Church takes power. The Pope exercises principal legislative, executive, and judicial power over the State of Vatican City (an entity distinct from the [[Holy See]]), which is a rare case of a non-hereditary monarchy.&lt;ref name=&quot;nationsencyclopedia1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/economies/Europe/Vatican-City-POLITICS-GOVERNMENT-AND-TAXATION.html|title=Vatican City (Politics, government, and taxation)|publisher=Nations Encyclopedia|accessdate=28 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vatican City is currently the only widely recognized independent state that has not become a member of the United Nations. The Holy See, which is distinct from Vatican City State, has [[United Nations General Assembly observers|permanent observer status]] with all the rights of a full member except for a vote in the [[United Nations General Assembly|UN General Assembly]].

===Political system===
The government of Vatican City has a unique structure. The Pope is the sovereign of the state. Legislative authority is vested in the [[Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State]], a body of cardinals appointed by the Pope for five-year periods. Executive power is in the hands of the President of that commission, assisted by the General Secretary and Deputy General Secretary. The state's foreign relations are entrusted to the Holy See's [[Secretariat of State (Holy See)|Secretariat of State]] and diplomatic service. Nevertheless, the pope has both absolute power in the executive, legislative and judicial branches over Vatican City. He is currently the only absolute monarch in Europe.

There are specific departments that deal with health, security, telecommunications, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic-pages.com/vatican/vatican_city.asp|accessdate=4 March 2007|title=Vatican City|work=Catholic-Pages.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church|Cardinal Camerlengo]] presides over the [[Apostolic Camera]] to which is entrusted the administration of the property and the protection of the temporal rights of the Holy See during a [[sede vacante|papal vacancy]]. Those of the Vatican State remain under the control of the Pontifical Commission for the State of Vatican City. Acting with three other cardinals chosen by lot every three days, one from each order of cardinals (cardinal bishop, cardinal priest, and cardinal deacon), he in a sense performs during that period the functions of head of state of Vatican City.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} All the decisions these four cardinals take must be approved by the [[College of Cardinals]] as a whole.

The nobility that was closely associated with the Holy See at the time of the Papal States continued to be associated with the Papal Court after the loss of these territories, generally with merely nominal duties (see [[Master of the Horse#Papal Master of the Horse|Papal Master of the Horse]], [[Prefecture of the Pontifical Household]], [[Hereditary officers of the Roman Curia]], [[Black Nobility]]). They also formed the ceremonial Noble Guard. In the first decades of the existence of the Vatican City State, [[executive functions]] were entrusted to some of them, including that of Delegate for the State of Vatican City (now denominated President of the Commission for Vatican City). But with the [[motu proprio]] ''[[Pontificalis Domus]]'' of 28 March 1968,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/motu_proprio/documents/hf_p-vi_motu-proprio_19680328_pontificalis-domus_lt.html ''Pontificalis Domus''], 3&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope Paul VI]] abolished the honorary positions that had continued to exist until then, such as [[Quartermaster general|Quartermaster General]] and [[Master of the Horse]].&lt;ref&gt;The site [http://www.chivalricorders.org/vatican/pplcourt.htm Hereditary Officers of the Papal Court] continues to present these functions and titles as still in use, several decades after their abolition.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vatican City State, created in 1929 by the Lateran Pacts, provides the Holy See with a temporal jurisdiction and independence within a small territory. It is distinct from the Holy See. The state can thus be deemed a significant but not essential instrument of the Holy See. The Holy See itself has existed continuously as a juridical entity since Roman Imperial times and has been internationally recognized as a powerful and independent sovereign entity since [[Late Antiquity|late antiquity]] to the present, without interruption even at times when it was deprived of territory (e.g. 1870 to 1929). The Holy See has the oldest active continuous diplomatic service in the world, dating back to at least AD 325 with its legation to the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicea]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholic-pages.com/vatican/diplomacy.asp Vatican Diplomacy, Catholic-Pages.com].

===Head of state===
{{Main|Pope}}
{{See also|List of Sovereigns of the Vatican City State}}
[[File:025Angelus.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Apostolic Palace]] (''Palazzo Apostolico''), the official residence of the Pope. Here, Benedict XVI is at the window marked by a maroon banner hanging from the windowsill at centre.]]
The Pope is [[Ex officio member|''ex officio'']] [[head of state]]&lt;ref&gt;One of the titles of the Pope listed in the [[Annuario Pontificio]] is &quot;[[List of Sovereigns of the Vatican City State|Sovereign of Vatican City State]]&quot; (page 23* in recent editions).&lt;/ref&gt; of Vatican City, functions dependent on his primordial function as bishop of the [[diocese of Rome]]. The term [[Holy See]] refers not to the Vatican state but to the Pope's spiritual and pastoral governance, largely exercised through the [[Roman Curia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P19.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 361] and [http://www.intratext.com/IXT/LAT0758/_P7.HTM Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, canon 48]&lt;/ref&gt; His official title with regard to Vatican City is ''Sovereign of the State of the Vatican City''.

[[Pope Francis]], born Jorge Mario Bergoglio in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]], was [[Papal conclave, 2013|elected]] on 13 March 2013. Francis took the unusual decision to live in the Vatican's guest house, [[Domus Sanctae Marthae]], rather than the [[Papal Apartments]] of the [[Apostolic Palace]] which is the official papal residence. He still carries out his business and meets foreign representatives in the Palace.

His principal subordinate government official for Vatican City is the [[President of the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State]], who since 1952 exercises the functions previously belonging to the [[Governor of Vatican City]]. Since 2001, the President of the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State also has the title of President of the Governorate of the State of Vatican City.  The current President is Italian Cardinal [[Giuseppe Bertello]], who was appointed on 1 October 2011.

===Administration===
[[Legislature|Legislative]] functions are delegated to the [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] [[Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State]], led by the [[President of the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State]]. Its seven members are cardinals appointed by the pope for terms of five years. Acts of the commission must be approved by the pope, through the Holy See's [[Secretariat of State (Holy See)|Secretariat of State]], and before taking effect must be published in a special appendix of the ''[[Acta Apostolicae Sedis]]''. Most of the content of this appendix consists of routine executive decrees, such as approval for a new set of postage stamps.

[[Executive (government)|Executive authority]] is delegated to the Governorate of Vatican City. The Governorate consists of the President of the Pontifical Commission—using the title &quot;President of the Governorate of Vatican City&quot;—a general secretary, and a Vice general secretary, each appointed by the pope for five-year terms. Important actions of the Governorate must be confirmed by the Pontifical Commission and by the Pope through the Secretariat of State.

The Governorate oversees the central governmental functions through several departments and offices. The directors and officials of these offices are appointed by the pope for five-year terms. These organs concentrate on material questions concerning the state's territory, including local security, records, transportation, and finances. The Governorate oversees a modern security &amp; police corps, the ''[[Corps of Gendarmerie of Vatican City|Corpo della Gendarmeria dello Stato della Città del Vaticano]]''.

[[Judiciary|Judicial]] functions are delegated to a supreme court, an appellate court, a tribunal ([[Tribunal of Vatican City State]]), and a trial judge. At the Vatican's request, sentences imposed can be served in Italy (see the [[#Crime|section on crime]], below).

The [[Postal code#Country code prefixes|international postal country code prefix]] is ''SCV'', and the only postal code is ''00120'' – altogether ''SCV-00120''.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;International postal code: SCV-00120.&quot; [http://www.vatican.va/news_services/press/documentazione/documents/sp_ss_scv/informazione_generale/sp_ss_scv_info-generale_en.html#Targa www.vatican.va] [[Holy See Press Office]] – General Information.

===Military and police===

[[File:Fiat Bravo Gendarmeria Vaticana.png|thumb|left|[[Corps of Gendarmerie of Vatican City|Gendarmerie]] Police car]]
{{Main|Military of Vatican City|Corps of Gendarmerie of Vatican City}}
The military defence of Vatican City is provided by Italy and its [[Military of Italy|armed forces]], given the fact that Vatican City is an enclave within Italy. Vatican City has no armed force of its own, the [[Swiss Guard]] being a corps of the Holy See responsible for the personal security of the Pope.

Though, like various European powers, earlier Popes recruited Swiss [[Mercenary|mercenaries]] as part of an army for the Papal States, the [[Pontifical Swiss Guard]] was founded by [[Pope Julius II]] on January 22, 1506 as the pope's personal bodyguard and continues to fulfill that function. It is listed in the [[Annuario Pontificio]] under &quot;Holy See&quot;, not under &quot;State of Vatican City&quot;. At the end of 2005, the Guard had 134 members. Recruitment is arranged by a special agreement between the Holy See and [[Switzerland]]. All recruits must be Catholic, unmarried males with Swiss citizenship who have completed their [[basic training]] with the [[Swiss Army]] with certificates of good conduct, be between the ages of 19 and 30, and be at least {{convert|174|cm|ftin|0|abbr=on}} in height. Members are equipped with [[small arms]] and the traditional [[halberd]] (also called the Swiss voulge), and trained in bodyguarding tactics.

The [[Palatine Guard]] and the [[Noble Guard (Vatican)|Noble Guard]] were disbanded by [[Pope Paul VI]] in 1970.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vatican State&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vaticanstate.va/EN/State_and_Government/History/Vatican_City_today.htm|title=Vatican City Today|publisher=Vatican City Government|accessdate=28 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the first body was founded as a militia at the service of the [[Papal States]], its functions within the Vatican state, like those of the Noble Guard, were merely ceremonial.

The [[Corps of Gendarmerie of Vatican City|Gendarmerie Corps]] (''Corpo della Gendarmeria'') is the [[gendarmerie]], or police and security force, of Vatican City and the [[extraterritorial properties of the Holy See]].&lt;ref&gt;''Il personale del Corpo garantisce la sicurezza e l'ordine pubblico anche nelle zone extraterritoriali di proprietà della Santa Sede.'' (The Corps also guarantees the security and the public order within the extraterritorial properties of the Holy See).

The corps has 130 personnel and is a part of the Security and Civil Defense Services Department (which also includes the Vatican Fire Brigade), an organ of the Governorate of Vatican City.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gendarme&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vaticanstate.va/EN/State_and_Government/Structure_Governorate/Gendarme_Corps.htm | title=Gendarme Corps | publisher=Office of the President of Vatican City State | year=2007 | accessdate=2007-10-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Administrations&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vaticanstate.va/EN/State_and_Government/Structure_Governorate/Administrations_and_Central_Offices.htm | title=Administrations and Central Offices | publisher=Office of the President of Vatican City State | year=2007 | accessdate=2007-10-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign relations===
[[File:0 Palazzo del Governatorato - Vatican.JPG|thumb|right|Palace of the Governorate of Vatican City State]]
[[File:Vatican City - main entrance with Swiss Guard.jpg|thumb|An entrance to Vatican City from Italy]]
{{See also|Foreign relations of the Holy See|List of diplomatic missions of the Holy See}}
Vatican City State is a recognized national territory under international law, but it is the Holy See that conducts diplomatic relations on its behalf, in addition to the Holy See's own diplomacy, entering into [[treaty|international agreements]] in its regard. Vatican City thus has no diplomatic service of its own.

Because of space limitations, Vatican City is one of the few countries in the world that is unable to host embassies. Foreign embassies to the Holy See are located in the city of Rome; only during the Second World War were the staff of some embassies accredited to the Holy See given what hospitality was possible within the narrow confines of Vatican City—embassies such as that of the United Kingdom while Rome was held by the Axis Powers and Germany's when the Allies controlled Rome.

The size of Vatican City is thus unrelated to the large global reach exercised by the Holy See as an entity quite distinct from the state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ukinholysee.fco.gov.uk/resources/en/news/2007/4485113/gregorian The Holy See and Diplomacy], ''[[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Vatican City State itself participates in some international organizations whose functions relate to the state as a geographical entity, distinct from the non-territorial legal persona of the Holy See. These organizations are much less numerous than those in which the Holy See participates either as a member or with observer status. They include the following eight, in each of which Vatican City State holds membership:&lt;ref name=Participation&gt;[http://www.vaticanstate.va/EN/State_and_Government/Internationalrelations/Participation_with_international_Organizations.htm Vatican City State: Participation in International Organizations]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also appendix at end of [http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/secretariat_state/documents/rc_seg-st_20010123_holy-see-relations_en.html Bilateral Relations of the Holy See]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of Vatican City}}

The Vatican City State budget&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;The Holy See's budget, which is distinct from that of Vatican City State, is supported financially by a variety of sources, including investments, real estate income, and donations from Catholic individuals, dioceses, and institutions; these help fund the Roman Curia (Vatican bureaucracy), diplomatic missions, and media outlets. Moreover, an annual collection taken up in dioceses and direct donations go to a non-budgetary fund known as Peter's Pence, which is used directly by the Pope for charity, disaster relief and aid to churches in developing nations.&lt;/ref&gt; includes the [[Vatican Museums]] and post office and is supported financially by the sale of [[Postage stamps and postal history of Vatican City|stamps]], [[Vatican euro coins|coins]], medals and tourist mementos; by fees for admission to museums; and by publications sales. The incomes and living standards of lay workers are comparable to those of counterparts who work in the city of Rome.&lt;ref name=&quot;economy factbook&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/vt.html|title=Holy See (Vatican City): Economy|work=CIA – The World Factbook|accessdate=10 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other industries include printing, the production of mosaics, and the manufacture of staff uniforms.

The [[Institute for Works of Religion]], also known as the Vatican Bank, and with the acronym IOR (''Istituto per le Opere di Religione''), is a bank situated in the Vatican that conducts worldwide financial activities. It has an [[automated teller machine|ATM]] with instructions in [[Latin]], possibly the only such ATM in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cardinalseansblog.org/?p=232|title=A Glimpse Inside the Vatican &amp; Msgr.

Vatican City issues its own coins. It has used the euro as its currency since 1 January 1999, owing to a special agreement with the European Union (council decision 1999/98/CE). Euro coins and notes were introduced on 1 January 2002—the Vatican does not issue [[euro banknotes]]. Issuance of euro-denominated coins is strictly limited by treaty, though somewhat more than usual is allowed in a year in which there is a change in the papacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/economic_and_monetary_affairs/institutional_and_economic_framework/l25040_en.htm|title=Agreements on monetary relations (Monaco, San Marino, the Vatican and Andorra)|accessdate=23 February 2007|work=Activities of the European Union: Summaries of legislation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of their rarity, Vatican euro coins are highly sought by collectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cathnews.acu.edu.au/604/100.html|title=Benedict Vatican euros set for release|accessdate=2014-09-25|work=Catholic News|date=21 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the adoption of the Euro, Vatican coinage and stamps were denominated in their own [[Vatican lira]] currency, which was on par with the Italian [[lira]].

Vatican City State, which employs nearly 2,000 people, had a surplus of 6.7&amp;nbsp;million euros in 2007 but ran a deficit in 2008 of over 15&amp;nbsp;million euros.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christiantelegraph.com/issue6216.html Christian Telegraph: Holy See's budget shortfall shrinks in 2008.] The report quoted deals mainly with the revenues and expenses of the Holy See and mentions only briefly the finances of Vatican City.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the U.S. State Department's International Narcotics Control Strategy Report listed Vatican City for the first time among the nations of concern for money-laundering, placing it in the middle category, which includes countries such as Ireland, but not among the most vulnerable countries, which include the United States itself, Germany, Italy and Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Pullella, Philip.

On 24 February 2014 the Vatican announced it was establishing a secretariat for the economy which will be responsible for all economic, financial and administrative activities of the Holy See and the Vatican City State. Cardinal [[George Pell]] is to head up the secretariat, the formation of which follows the charging last month of two senior clerics including a monsignor with money laundering. [[Pope Francis]] also appointed an auditor-general authorized to do random audits of any agency at any time, and engaged a US financial services company to review the Vatican's 19,000 accounts to ensure compliance with international money laundering practices. The pontiff also ordered that the [[Administration of the Patrimony of the Apostolic See]] will become the Vatican's central bank, with responsibilities similar to other central banks around the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;VaticanEconomicSecretariat&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Vatican financial system restructuring begins with new secretariat|url=http://www.theitalynews.net/index.php/sid/220216280/scat/145bb158ac2f80f2/ht/Vatican-financial-system-restructuring-begins-with-new-secretariat|accessdate=24 February 2014|publisher=''The Italy News.Net''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==

===Population and languages===
{{further|Languages of Vatican City}}
[[File:Seal of Vatican City.svg|thumb|right|The Seal of Vatican City. Note the use of the Italian language.]]
Almost all of Vatican City's 839 (2013 est.)&lt;ref name=&quot;factbook&quot;/&gt; citizens either live inside the Vatican's walls or serve in the Holy See's [[List of diplomatic missions of the Holy See|diplomatic service]] in embassies (called &quot;[[Apostolic Nunciature|nunciatures]]&quot;; a papal ambassador is a &quot;nuncio&quot;) around the world. The Vatican citizenry consists almost entirely of two groups: clergy, most of whom work in the service of the Holy See, and a very few as officials of the state; and the Swiss Guard. Most of the 2,400 lay workers who comprise the majority of the Vatican workforce reside outside the Vatican and are citizens of Italy, while a few are citizens of other nations. As a result, all of the City's actual citizens are Catholic as are all the [[Place of worship|places of worship]].

Vatican City has no formally enacted [[official language]], but, unlike the Holy See which most often uses [[Latin]] for the authoritative version of its official documents, Vatican City uses only Italian in its legislation and official communications.&lt;ref&gt;Vatican City State appendix to the [[Acta Apostolicae Sedis]] is entirely in Italian.&lt;/ref&gt; Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those who work in the state. In the [[Swiss Guard]], German is the language used for giving commands, but the individual guards take their oath of loyalty in their own languages: German, French, [[Romansh language|Romansh]] or Italian. Vatican City's official website languages are Italian, English, French, German, and Spanish. (This site should not be confused with that of the Holy See, which uses all these languages, along with Portuguese, with Latin since 9 May 2008 and Chinese since 18 March 2009.)

===Citizenship===

Unlike [[citizenship]] of other states, which is based either on ''[[jus sanguinis]]'' (birth from a citizen, even outside the state's territory) or on ''[[jus soli]]'' (birth within the territory of the state), citizenship of Vatican City is granted ''jus officii'', namely on the grounds of appointment to work in a certain capacity in the service of the Holy See. It usually ceases upon cessation of the appointment. Citizenship is extended also to the spouse, parents and descendants of a citizen, provided they are living with the person who is a citizen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees |url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/category,LEGAL,,LEGISLATION,VAT,3ae6b52f10,0.html |title=Law on Citizenship and Residence, 7 June 1992 |publisher=Unhcr.org |date=7 June 1992 |accessdate=15 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/news_services/press/documentazione/documents/sp_ss_scv/informazione_generale/cittadinanza_it.html |title=Cittadinanza vaticana |publisher=Vatican.va |date=31 December 2001 |accessdate=15 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Holy See]], not being a country, issues only diplomatic and service passports, whereas Vatican City State issues normal passports for its citizens.

Anyone who loses Vatican citizenship and does not possess other citizenship automatically becomes an [[Italian citizenship|Italian citizen]] as provided in the Lateran Treaty.&lt;ref name='treaty'/&gt;

As of 31 December 2005, there were, apart from the Pope himself, 557 people with Vatican citizenship, while there were 246 residents in the state who did not have its citizenship.

Of the 557 citizens, 74% were clergy:
* 58 [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]], resident in Rome, mostly outside the Vatican;
* 293 clergy, members of the Holy See's diplomatic missions, resident in other countries, and forming well over half the total of the citizens;
* 62 other clergy, working but not necessarily living in the Vatican.

The 101 members of the [[Pontifical Swiss Guard]] constituted 18% of the total, and there were only 55 other lay persons with Vatican citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/news_services/press/documentazione/documents/sp_ss_scv/informazione_generale/cittadini-vaticani_en.html|title=Vatican citizenship|accessdate=3 December 2006|publisher=Holy See Press Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LawNowAllows/&gt;

On 22 February 2011, Pope Benedict XVI promulgated a new &quot;Law concerning citizenship, residency and access&quot; to Vatican City, which became effective on 1 March. It replaced the 1929 &quot;Law concerning citizenship and residence&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Law on Citizenship, Residency and Access to the Vatican|date=1 March 2011|publisher=VIS – Vatican Information Service|url=http://visnews-en.blogspot.com/2011/03/law-on-citizenship-residency-and-access.html|accessdate=1 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are 16 articles in the new law, whereas the old law had 33 articles.&lt;ref name=LawNowAllows&gt;{{cite web|title=Law Now Allows for Vatican Residents: 1929 Code Replaced|date=2 March 2011|publisher=Innovative Media, Inc.|work=ZENIT|url=http://www.zenit.org/article-31900?l=english|accessdate=2 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It updated the old law by incorporating changes made after 1929, such as the 1940 granting of Vatican City citizenship, ''durante munere'', to the members of the Holy See's diplomatic service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toscanaoggi.it/Vita-Chiesa/STATO-CITTA-DEL-VATICANO-NUOVA-LEGGE-SULLA-CITTADINANZA &quot;Stato Città del Vaticano: Nuova legge sulla cittadinanza&quot; in ''Toscana Oggi'', 3 January 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; It also created a new category, that of official Vatican &quot;residents&quot;, i.e., people living in Vatican City; these are not necessarily Vatican citizens.&lt;ref name=LawNowAllows/&gt;

On 1 March 2011, only 220 of the over 800 people living in Vatican City were citizens. There was a total of 572 Vatican citizens, of whom 352 were not residents, mainly [[apostolic nuncio]]s and diplomatic staff.&lt;ref name=LawNowAllows/&gt;

Vatican City is home to some of the most famous art in the world. [[St. Peter's Basilica]], whose successive architects include [[Bramante]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Giacomo della Porta]], [[Carlo Maderno|Maderno]] and [[Bernini]], is a renowned work of [[Renaissance architecture]]. The [[Sistine Chapel]] is famous for its frescos, which include works by [[Perugino]], [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]] and [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]] as well as the [[Sistine Chapel ceiling|ceiling]] and [[Last Judgment]] by [[Michelangelo]]. Artists who decorated the interiors of the Vatican include [[Raphael]] and [[Fra Angelico]].

The [[Vatican Library|Vatican Apostolic Library]] and the collections of the [[Vatican Museums]] are of the highest historical, scientific and cultural importance. In 1984, the Vatican was added by [[UNESCO]] to the List of [[World Heritage Site]]s; it is the only one to consist of an entire state.&lt;ref name=&quot;UNESCO&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/286 |title=Vatican City – UNESCO World Heritage Centre |publisher=whc.unesco.org |accessdate=10 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, it is the only site to date registered with the UNESCO as a ''centre containing monuments'' in the &quot;International Register of Cultural Property under Special Protection&quot; according to the 1954 [[Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict]].&lt;ref name=&quot;UNESCO&quot;/&gt;

{{Main|Transport in Vatican City}}
Vatican City has a reasonably well developed transport network considering its size (consisting mostly of a piazza and walkways). As a country that is 1.05&amp;nbsp;kilometres (0.6&amp;nbsp;mi) long and 0.85&amp;nbsp;kilometres (0.5&amp;nbsp;mi) wide,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/news_services/press/documentazione/documents/sp_ss_scv/informazione_generale/sp_ss_scv_info-generale_en.html|title=Holy See – State of the Vatican City|publisher=Vatican Papal Conclave|accessdate=28 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has a small [[Transport network|transportation system]] with no airports or highways. The only aviation facility in Vatican City is the [[Vatican City Heliport]]. There is a [[standard gauge]] [[rail transport in Vatican City|railway]] connected to Italy's network at Rome's Saint Peter's station by an {{Convert|852|m|yd|adj=mid|-long}} spur, {{Convert|300|m|yd|}} of which is within Vatican territory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sinfin&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sinfin.net/railways/world/vatican/vaticanrail.html#Origini Vatican City State Railway|title=Railways of the World|publisher=Sinfin.net|accessdate=8 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pope John XXIII]] was the first Pope to make use of this railway.  [[Pope John Paul II]] rarely used it. The railway is mainly used to transport freight.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sinfin&quot;/&gt; As Vatican City has no airports (it is one of the few [[List of countries without an airport|independent states]] in the world without one, except for the aforementioned heliport), it is served by the airports that serve the city of Rome, namely: [[Leonardo da Vinci-Fiumicino Airport]] and to a lesser extent, [[Rome Ciampino Airport|Ciampino Airport]], both of which serve as the departure gateway for the Pope's international visits.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sinfin&quot;/&gt;

The City&lt;!--Referring to Vatican City, not city.

The [[Mail|postal system]] was founded on 11 February 1929, and two days later became operational. On 1 August, the state started to release its own postal stamps, under the authority of the [[Philatelic and Numismatic Office of the Vatican City State]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vaticanphilately.org/vc.htm|title=The Early Definitives|publisher=Vatican Philatelic Society|accessdate=28 November 2007 |archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20071211191109/http://www.vaticanphilately.org/vc.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate= 11 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The City's [[Mail|postal service]] is sometimes recognised as &quot;the best in the world&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950CEFDE1738F934A15755C0A9629C8B63&amp;n=Top/News/World/Countries%20and%20Territories/Vatican%20City|title=Hail Marys Not Needed: Vatican Mail Will Deliver|work=New York Times |accessdate=28 November 2007 |first=Al |last=Baker |date=27 June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and mail has been noted to get to its target before the postal service in Rome.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT&quot;/&gt;

The Vatican also controls its own Internet [[Top-level domain|TLD]], which is registered as ([[.va]]). Broadband service is widely provided within Vatican City. Vatican City has also been given a radio [[ITU prefix]], HV, and this is sometimes used by [[amateur radio]] operators.

[[Vatican Radio]], which was organised by [[Guglielmo Marconi]], broadcasts on [[Shortwave|short-wave]], [[Medium wave|medium-wave]] and FM frequencies and on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/news_services/radio/index.htm |title=Vatican Radio – Index |publisher=Vatican.va |date=2 September 2005 |accessdate=6 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its main transmission antennae are located in Italian territory. Television services are provided through another entity, the [[Vatican Television Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/news_services/television/index.htm |title=Vatican Television Center – Index |publisher=Vatican.va |accessdate=6 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[L'Osservatore Romano]]'' is the multilingual semi-official newspaper of the Holy See. It is published by a private corporation under the direction of Roman Catholic laymen but reports on official information. However, the official texts of documents are in the ''[[Acta Apostolicae Sedis]]'', the [[Gazette|official gazette]] of the Holy See, which has an appendix for documents of the Vatican City State.

Vatican Radio, the Vatican Television Center, and L'Osservatore Romano are organs not of the Vatican State but of the Holy See, and are listed as such in the [[Annuario Pontificio]], which places them in the section &quot;Institutions linked with the Holy See&quot;, ahead of the sections on the Holy See's diplomatic service abroad and the [[Diplomatic corps|Diplomatic Corps]] accredited to the Holy See, after which is placed the section on the State of Vatican City.

Persons accused of crimes recognized as such both in Italy and in Vatican City that are committed in Italian territory will be handed over to the Italian authorities if they take refuge in Vatican City or in buildings that under the treaty enjoy immunity.&lt;ref name=&quot;treaty1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shea|first=Alison |title=Researching the Law of the Vatican City State|url=http://www.nyulawglobal.org/globalex/vatican1.htm |work=Hauser Global Law School Program |publisher=[[New York University School of Law]] |accessdate=13 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vatican City has no prison system, apart from a few detention cells for pre-trial detention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2012/05/paolo_gabriele_case_how_does_the_vatican_deal_with_criminals_.html How Does Vatican City Deal With Criminals?] ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]''. 30 May 2012.
