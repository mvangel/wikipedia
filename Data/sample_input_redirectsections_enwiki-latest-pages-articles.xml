      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Bridges Baronetcy''', of Goodnestone in the County of Kent, was created in the [[Baronetage of Great Britain]] on 19 April 1718 for Brook Bridges. His son the second Baronet, died in 1733 whilst in office as [[High Sheriff of Kent]]. His grandson, the third Baronet, represented [[Kent (UK Parliament constituency)|Kent]] in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]. In 1842, the fifth Baronet (the grandson of the third Baronet), unsuccessfully claimed the ancient [[Baron FitzWalter|barony of FitzWalter]] (which had been in [[abeyance]] since 1756) as a descendant of Mary, sister of the seventeenth Baron FitzWalter. He later sat as a [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Kent East (UK Parliament constituency)|Kent East]]. In 1868 he was created '''Baron FitzWalter''', of Woodham Walter in the County of Essex, in the [[Peerage of the United Kingdom]]. However, the peerage became extinct on his death, while he was succeeded in the baronetcy by his younger brother, the sixth Baronet. On his death the title passed to his first cousin, the seventh Baronet. He was the son of Reverend Brook Henry Bridges, third son of the third Baronet. When he died this line of the family also failed and the title was passed on to his first cousin, the eighth Baronet. He was the son of Reverend Brook Edward Bridges, fourth son of the third Baronet. He never married and on his death in 1899 the baronetcy became extinct.

The seat of the Bridges family was [[Goodnestone, Dover|Goodnestone Park]] in [[Kent]]. The house was built in 1704 by the first Bridges Baronet. After the death of the last Baronet in 1899 the house came into the Plumptre family through the marriage of  Eleanor Bridges, daughter of the fourth Bridges Baronet, to Reverend Henry Western Plumptre. In 1924 the abeyance of the barony of FitzWalter was terminated in favour of the latter's grandson, John Bridges Plumptre.

'''Trent Addison Edwards''' (born October 30, 1983) is an [[American football]] [[quarterback]] who is currently a [[free agent]]. He played [[college football]] at [[Stanford Cardinal football|Stanford]] and was drafted by the [[Buffalo Bills]] in the third round of the [[2007 NFL Draft]].

He has also been a member of the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]], [[Oakland Raiders]], [[Philadelphia Eagles]] and [[Chicago Bears]].

==Early years==
Edwards was a highly rated recruit from [[Los Gatos High School]] and was ranked as the #1 pro-style quarterback by ''[[USA Today]]'' in 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;USAToday&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Emfinger|first=Max|title=A midsummer look: A dandy dozen quarterbacks|work=USA Today|date=July 18, 2001|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/football/recruiting/2001-07-17-maxcol.htm|accessdate=2007-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Rivals.com'' rated Edwards as the #2 pro-style quarterback and #20 player overall in its rankings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rivals100.rivals.com/viewprospect.asp?Sport=1&amp;pr_key=1949|title=Trent Edwards Profile - Football Recruiting|publisher=Rivals100.rivals.com|date=|accessdate=2010-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was recruited by [[University of Michigan|Michigan]], [[University of Florida|Florida]], [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]] and [[University of Tennessee|Tennessee]], but ultimately chose [[Stanford University|Stanford]]. In his junior and senior seasons at Los Gatos, he led the team to two undefeated seasons and back-to-back [[Central Coast Section]] Division III championships with a combined record of 26-0. In his senior year, he completed 154 of 213 passes for 2,535 yards, 29 touchdowns, three interceptions, and was named as a National Football Foundation Hall of Fame Scholar-Athlete for Santa Clara County.

As a teenager, Edwards participated in the Armenian-American Summer Games in Northern California. Edwards's grandfather, Ben Morjig, was a co-founder of the games.&lt;ref name=&quot;WAAA&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=37th Annual Armenian Summer Games|work=W.A.A.A.|year=2007|url=http://www.armeniansummergames.com/2007%20Files/News/2007%20Second%20Press%20Release.htm|pages=56–57|accessdate=2008-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==College career==
At Stanford, Edwards sat out his freshman year in 2002 so he could concentrate on his studies, and began 2003 behind starter Chris Lewis. After an impressive showing as a backup, Edwards got the start for four games, but was then sidelined with a shoulder injury for the rest of the season. In 2004, Edwards was the starter, but again suffered injuries that knocked him out of two games and kept him out of two others entirely. Edwards' best year was 2005, where he started all 11 games, completed 168 of 268 passes for 1934 yards and 17 touchdowns, leading the Cardinal to a 5-6 record.&lt;ref name=&quot;mediaguide06&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Player Bio: Trent Edwards

|pages=56–57
|accessdate=2007-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Edwards was the starter for the first seven games, but suffered a season-ending broken foot against [[University of Arizona|Arizona]] and relinquished the starting role to [[T.C. Ostrander]]. Despite Stanford's poor performance during his tenure as starting quarterback (the Cardinal was just 10-20 in games he started), Edwards was a highly touted quarterback prospect in the [[2007 NFL Draft]] due to his arm strength, accuracy, and intelligence.  The summer before 2006, Edwards worked as a [[Synopsys]] intern.  He decided to pass up a career in the [[electronic design automation]] industry for the NFL.&lt;ref name=&quot;ScottWright&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Trent Edwards Scouting Report

==Professional career==

===Buffalo Bills===
[[File:Trent Edwards.jpg|thumb|right|Trent Edwards passes the ball in a 2007 game against the [[New York Jets]].]]
Edwards was drafted by the [[Buffalo Bills]] in the third round (92nd overall) of the [[2007 NFL Draft]]. Edwards was a part of the [[Willis McGahee]] trade that sent McGahee to the [[Baltimore Ravens]] for the Ravens' third-round pick in March 2007.  After the draft, [[Bill Walsh (American football coach)|Bill Walsh]], the [[NFL Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] head coach contacted Bills General Manager [[Marv Levy]] to express his confidence in Edwards' abilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;espn2007&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/wire?section=nfl&amp;id=3038418|publisher=ESPN|title=Rookie QB Trent Edwards gets chance to spark Bills offense in 1st start|date=September 27, 2007|accessdate=2008-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2007====
Edwards made his NFL debut on September 23, 2007 in the Bills' third regular season game against the [[New England Patriots]], after the Bills' starter [[J. P. Losman]] was injured in the first quarter.

In his first game, Edwards completed 10 of 20 passes for 97 yards with no touchdowns and one interception. In his first NFL start on September 30, 2007 against the [[New York Jets]], he made 22 of 28 passes for 234 yards with a touchdown and an interception, leading the Bills to their first win of the season. His first NFL touchdown was a one yard play-action pass on fourth and goal to [[Michael Gaines]]. In his second start, against the [[Dallas Cowboys]], Edwards completed 23 of 31 pass attempts for 176 yards and an interception.

During the game against the [[New York Jets]] in week 8, Edwards sprained his right wrist, and was held out of the next game, allowing Losman to reclaim the starting job. In week 13, following a string of poor performances by Losman, Bills coach [[Dick Jauron]] named Edwards the starter against the [[Washington Redskins]].&lt;ref name=tsn&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsnetwork.com/default.asp?c=sportsnetwork&amp;page=/nfl/news/ABN4114579.htm|publisher=The Sports Network|title=Bills Name Edwards Starter|date=November 26, 2007|accessdate=2007-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edwards led the Bills to a victory over the Redskins in which he led his first fourth quarter comeback, completing three passes to set up the game-winning field goal. As a result, he was named the NFL Rookie of the Week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buffalonews.com/sports/story/220527.html|title=Emotional rescue for Bills}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following week against the winless [[Miami Dolphins]], he passed for 165 yards and a career high four touchdown passes to lead the Bills to a 38-17 win. Despite losing the last three games of the season, Edwards was named to the all-rookie team after the season was completed.

====2008====
During the week 5 contest against the [[Arizona Cardinals]] on October 5, Edwards suffered a concussion as a result of a hard hit by [[Adrian Wilson (American football)|Adrian Wilson]] on the third play of the game and did not return for the rest of the game. However, Edwards returned in the following game in week 7 against the [[San Diego Chargers]] and completed 25 of 30 passes in a 23-14 win. He was selected as the [[FedEx Air &amp; Ground NFL Players of the Week|FedEx Air Player of the Week]] for his performance.

In week 13, against the [[San Francisco 49ers]], Edwards suffered a groin injury and did not return for the rest of the game. He was sidelined the following two games as a result of the injury. He returned for the final two games of the season. After a 5-1 start, the Bills missed the playoffs for the 9th straight season after losing 8 of the remaining 10 games.

====2009====
Edwards' 2009 season was further plagued by inconsistency and injuries. The Bills lost four of their first five games of the season, during which Edwards' play was noted as inconsistent, affected by poor performances by the Bills' offensive line. Within the first 5 games, Edwards was sacked 18 times. Edwards' worst performance during this time period was week 4 against the [[Miami Dolphins|Dolphins]] in which he recorded a season low [[passer rating]] of 51.0, threw for a season game-high 3 interceptions, was sacked 6 times, and recorded his only fumble of the season.

On October 18, Edwards suffered a concussion early in the second quarter against the [[New York Jets|Jets]] as a result of a hit by [[New York Jets|Jets]] [[linebackers]] [[David Harris (American football)|Harris]] and [[Calvin Pace|Pace]]. He did not return for the rest of the game, and missed the following two games. He returned after the bye week to start against the [[Tennessee Titans]], but continued to struggle, at one point missing a wide-open [[Terrell Owens|Owens]] and then throwing an interception that was returned for a touchdown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2009111506/2009/REG10/bills@titans#tab:recap/recap-channels:cat-post-recap-full-story|publisher=NFL.com|title=Buffalo Bills at Tennessee Titans - 2009 Week 10|accessdate=2010-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He finished the game completing 18 of 28 passes for 185 yards with a touchdown and an interception, as the Bills were routed to a 41-17 loss.

Following the game against the [[Tennessee Titans|Titans]], Edwards was benched for the remaining 7 games in favor of [[Ryan Fitzpatrick]]. He did not play for the rest of the season except for making a brief appearance during the week 15 game against the [[New England Patriots]] when he spelled [[Ryan Fitzpatrick|Fitzpatrick]] in the fourth quarter. Edwards completed 1 of 2 passes for -1 yards before being carted off the field, injuring his right knee as a result of a sack by [[New England Patriots|Patriots]] defender [[Tully Banta-Cain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2009122001/2009/REG15/patriots@bills|publisher=NFL.com|title=New England Patriots at Buffalo Bills - 2009 Week 15|accessdate=2010-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2010====
Edwards faced competition from quarterbacks Ryan Fitzpatrick and [[Brian Brohm]] for the Bills' starting quarterback position in [[2010 Buffalo Bills season|2010]]. Edwards won the battle and started in all four of the Bills' preseason games. In their first two games of the regular season, Edwards threw for only 152 yards combined, and the Bills lost both games. On his final play as a Bill, against [[2010 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay]], Edwards ran out of bounds on a fourth down scramble, 7 yards short of the first down marker with 1:10 to go. 

Edwards was benched the following day&lt;ref&gt;September 20, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; in favor of Fitzpatrick, who would be the Bills' full-time starter for the next three seasons. The Bills waived Edwards on September 27, one day after Fitpatrick threw for 247 yards in a Week Three game against [[2010 New England Patriots season|New England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2010/football/nfl/09/27/bills.edwards.ap/index.html?eref=sircrc|title=Buffalo Bills release QB Trent Edwards one week after benching - NFL - SI.com|publisher=Sportsillustrated.cnn.com|date=2010-09-27|accessdate=2010-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jacksonville Jaguars===
Edwards was claimed off waivers by the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]] on September 28. He was the backup quarterback behind [[David Garrard]], and wore jersey #5.

Edwards made his first appearance for the Jaguars on October 18, 2010, against the Tennessee Titans on Monday Night Football, when starting quarterback David Garrard left the game after suffering a concussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Titans vs. Jaguars - Recap

|accessdate=2010-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oakland Raiders===
After becoming a free agent following the 2010 season, Edwards signed with the [[Oakland Raiders]] on July 30, 2011, and was released on September 3, during the final roster cuts.

===Philadelphia Eagles===
On February 23, 2012, Edwards signed a one-year deal with the [[Philadelphia Eagles]].

Edwards had a disappointing mini camp, and was viewed as a roster filler. However, he started to warm up in training camp, and found his opportunity in the preseason, after [[quarterback]] [[Mike Kafka]] broke his non-throwing hand at the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]. Edwards went 54-of-80 for 489 yards, with four touchdowns and zero [[interceptions]]. The team cut Kafka on August 31, meaning Edwards had won the job as third string quarterback, after the rookie [[Nick Foles]]. Edwards was released on April 15, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosenthal|first=Gregg|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000159996/article/philadelphia-eagles-release-trent-edwards|title=Philadelphia Eagles release Trent Edwards|publisher=[[National Football League]]|date=April 15, 2013|accessdate=April 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chicago Bears===

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Bridges Baronetcy''', of Goodnestone in the County of Kent, was created in the [[Baronetage of Great Britain]] on 19 April 1718 for Brook Bridges. His son the second Baronet, died in 1733 whilst in office as [[High Sheriff of Kent]]. His grandson, the third Baronet, represented [[Kent (UK Parliament constituency)|Kent]] in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]. In 1842, the fifth Baronet (the grandson of the third Baronet), unsuccessfully claimed the ancient [[Baron FitzWalter|barony of FitzWalter]] (which had been in [[abeyance]] since 1756) as a descendant of Mary, sister of the seventeenth Baron FitzWalter. He later sat as a [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Kent East (UK Parliament constituency)|Kent East]]. In 1868 he was created '''Baron FitzWalter''', of Woodham Walter in the County of Essex, in the [[Peerage of the United Kingdom]]. However, the peerage became extinct on his death, while he was succeeded in the baronetcy by his younger brother, the sixth Baronet. On his death the title passed to his first cousin, the seventh Baronet. He was the son of Reverend Brook Henry Bridges, third son of the third Baronet. When he died this line of the family also failed and the title was passed on to his first cousin, the eighth Baronet. He was the son of Reverend Brook Edward Bridges, fourth son of the third Baronet. He never married and on his death in 1899 the baronetcy became extinct.

The seat of the Bridges family was [[Goodnestone, Dover|Goodnestone Park]] in [[Kent]]. The house was built in 1704 by the first Bridges Baronet. After the death of the last Baronet in 1899 the house came into the Plumptre family through the marriage of  Eleanor Bridges, daughter of the fourth Bridges Baronet, to Reverend Henry Western Plumptre. In 1924 the abeyance of the barony of FitzWalter was terminated in favour of the latter's grandson, John Bridges Plumptre.

'''Trent Addison Edwards''' (born October 30, 1983) is an [[American football]] [[quarterback]] who is currently a [[free agent]]. He played [[college football]] at [[Stanford Cardinal football|Stanford]] and was drafted by the [[Buffalo Bills]] in the third round of the [[2007 NFL Draft]].

He has also been a member of the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]], [[Oakland Raiders]], [[Philadelphia Eagles]] and [[Chicago Bears]].

==Early years==
Edwards was a highly rated recruit from [[Los Gatos High School]] and was ranked as the #1 pro-style quarterback by ''[[USA Today]]'' in 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;USAToday&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Emfinger|first=Max|title=A midsummer look: A dandy dozen quarterbacks|work=USA Today|date=July 18, 2001|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/football/recruiting/2001-07-17-maxcol.htm|accessdate=2007-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Rivals.com'' rated Edwards as the #2 pro-style quarterback and #20 player overall in its rankings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rivals100.rivals.com/viewprospect.asp?Sport=1&amp;pr_key=1949|title=Trent Edwards Profile - Football Recruiting|publisher=Rivals100.rivals.com|date=|accessdate=2010-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was recruited by [[University of Michigan|Michigan]], [[University of Florida|Florida]], [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]] and [[University of Tennessee|Tennessee]], but ultimately chose [[Stanford University|Stanford]]. In his junior and senior seasons at Los Gatos, he led the team to two undefeated seasons and back-to-back [[Central Coast Section]] Division III championships with a combined record of 26-0. In his senior year, he completed 154 of 213 passes for 2,535 yards, 29 touchdowns, three interceptions, and was named as a National Football Foundation Hall of Fame Scholar-Athlete for Santa Clara County.

As a teenager, Edwards participated in the Armenian-American Summer Games in Northern California. Edwards's grandfather, Ben Morjig, was a co-founder of the games.&lt;ref name=&quot;WAAA&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=37th Annual Armenian Summer Games|work=W.A.A.A.|year=2007|url=http://www.armeniansummergames.com/2007%20Files/News/2007%20Second%20Press%20Release.htm|pages=56–57|accessdate=2008-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==College career==
At Stanford, Edwards sat out his freshman year in 2002 so he could concentrate on his studies, and began 2003 behind starter Chris Lewis. After an impressive showing as a backup, Edwards got the start for four games, but was then sidelined with a shoulder injury for the rest of the season. In 2004, Edwards was the starter, but again suffered injuries that knocked him out of two games and kept him out of two others entirely. Edwards' best year was 2005, where he started all 11 games, completed 168 of 268 passes for 1934 yards and 17 touchdowns, leading the Cardinal to a 5-6 record.&lt;ref name=&quot;mediaguide06&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Player Bio: Trent Edwards

|pages=56–57
|accessdate=2007-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Edwards was the starter for the first seven games, but suffered a season-ending broken foot against [[University of Arizona|Arizona]] and relinquished the starting role to [[T.C. Ostrander]]. Despite Stanford's poor performance during his tenure as starting quarterback (the Cardinal was just 10-20 in games he started), Edwards was a highly touted quarterback prospect in the [[2007 NFL Draft]] due to his arm strength, accuracy, and intelligence.  The summer before 2006, Edwards worked as a [[Synopsys]] intern.  He decided to pass up a career in the [[electronic design automation]] industry for the NFL.&lt;ref name=&quot;ScottWright&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Trent Edwards Scouting Report

==Professional career==

===Buffalo Bills===
[[File:Trent Edwards.jpg|thumb|right|Trent Edwards passes the ball in a 2007 game against the [[New York Jets]].]]
Edwards was drafted by the [[Buffalo Bills]] in the third round (92nd overall) of the [[2007 NFL Draft]]. Edwards was a part of the [[Willis McGahee]] trade that sent McGahee to the [[Baltimore Ravens]] for the Ravens' third-round pick in March 2007.  After the draft, [[Bill Walsh (American football coach)|Bill Walsh]], the [[NFL Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] head coach contacted Bills General Manager [[Marv Levy]] to express his confidence in Edwards' abilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;espn2007&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/wire?section=nfl&amp;id=3038418|publisher=ESPN|title=Rookie QB Trent Edwards gets chance to spark Bills offense in 1st start|date=September 27, 2007|accessdate=2008-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2007====
Edwards made his NFL debut on September 23, 2007 in the Bills' third regular season game against the [[New England Patriots]], after the Bills' starter [[J. P. Losman]] was injured in the first quarter.

In his first game, Edwards completed 10 of 20 passes for 97 yards with no touchdowns and one interception. In his first NFL start on September 30, 2007 against the [[New York Jets]], he made 22 of 28 passes for 234 yards with a touchdown and an interception, leading the Bills to their first win of the season. His first NFL touchdown was a one yard play-action pass on fourth and goal to [[Michael Gaines]]. In his second start, against the [[Dallas Cowboys]], Edwards completed 23 of 31 pass attempts for 176 yards and an interception.

During the game against the [[New York Jets]] in week 8, Edwards sprained his right wrist, and was held out of the next game, allowing Losman to reclaim the starting job. In week 13, following a string of poor performances by Losman, Bills coach [[Dick Jauron]] named Edwards the starter against the [[Washington Redskins]].&lt;ref name=tsn&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsnetwork.com/default.asp?c=sportsnetwork&amp;page=/nfl/news/ABN4114579.htm|publisher=The Sports Network|title=Bills Name Edwards Starter|date=November 26, 2007|accessdate=2007-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edwards led the Bills to a victory over the Redskins in which he led his first fourth quarter comeback, completing three passes to set up the game-winning field goal. As a result, he was named the NFL Rookie of the Week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buffalonews.com/sports/story/220527.html|title=Emotional rescue for Bills}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following week against the winless [[Miami Dolphins]], he passed for 165 yards and a career high four touchdown passes to lead the Bills to a 38-17 win. Despite losing the last three games of the season, Edwards was named to the all-rookie team after the season was completed.

====2008====
During the week 5 contest against the [[Arizona Cardinals]] on October 5, Edwards suffered a concussion as a result of a hard hit by [[Adrian Wilson (American football)|Adrian Wilson]] on the third play of the game and did not return for the rest of the game. However, Edwards returned in the following game in week 7 against the [[San Diego Chargers]] and completed 25 of 30 passes in a 23-14 win. He was selected as the [[FedEx Air &amp; Ground NFL Players of the Week|FedEx Air Player of the Week]] for his performance.

In week 13, against the [[San Francisco 49ers]], Edwards suffered a groin injury and did not return for the rest of the game. He was sidelined the following two games as a result of the injury. He returned for the final two games of the season. After a 5-1 start, the Bills missed the playoffs for the 9th straight season after losing 8 of the remaining 10 games.

====2009====
Edwards' 2009 season was further plagued by inconsistency and injuries. The Bills lost four of their first five games of the season, during which Edwards' play was noted as inconsistent, affected by poor performances by the Bills' offensive line. Within the first 5 games, Edwards was sacked 18 times. Edwards' worst performance during this time period was week 4 against the [[Miami Dolphins|Dolphins]] in which he recorded a season low [[passer rating]] of 51.0, threw for a season game-high 3 interceptions, was sacked 6 times, and recorded his only fumble of the season.

On October 18, Edwards suffered a concussion early in the second quarter against the [[New York Jets|Jets]] as a result of a hit by [[New York Jets|Jets]] [[linebackers]] [[David Harris (American football)|Harris]] and [[Calvin Pace|Pace]]. He did not return for the rest of the game, and missed the following two games. He returned after the bye week to start against the [[Tennessee Titans]], but continued to struggle, at one point missing a wide-open [[Terrell Owens|Owens]] and then throwing an interception that was returned for a touchdown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2009111506/2009/REG10/bills@titans#tab:recap/recap-channels:cat-post-recap-full-story|publisher=NFL.com|title=Buffalo Bills at Tennessee Titans - 2009 Week 10|accessdate=2010-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He finished the game completing 18 of 28 passes for 185 yards with a touchdown and an interception, as the Bills were routed to a 41-17 loss.

Following the game against the [[Tennessee Titans|Titans]], Edwards was benched for the remaining 7 games in favor of [[Ryan Fitzpatrick]]. He did not play for the rest of the season except for making a brief appearance during the week 15 game against the [[New England Patriots]] when he spelled [[Ryan Fitzpatrick|Fitzpatrick]] in the fourth quarter. Edwards completed 1 of 2 passes for -1 yards before being carted off the field, injuring his right knee as a result of a sack by [[New England Patriots|Patriots]] defender [[Tully Banta-Cain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2009122001/2009/REG15/patriots@bills|publisher=NFL.com|title=New England Patriots at Buffalo Bills - 2009 Week 15|accessdate=2010-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2010====
Edwards faced competition from quarterbacks Ryan Fitzpatrick and [[Brian Brohm]] for the Bills' starting quarterback position in [[2010 Buffalo Bills season|2010]]. Edwards won the battle and started in all four of the Bills' preseason games. In their first two games of the regular season, Edwards threw for only 152 yards combined, and the Bills lost both games. On his final play as a Bill, against [[2010 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay]], Edwards ran out of bounds on a fourth down scramble, 7 yards short of the first down marker with 1:10 to go. 

Edwards was benched the following day&lt;ref&gt;September 20, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; in favor of Fitzpatrick, who would be the Bills' full-time starter for the next three seasons. The Bills waived Edwards on September 27, one day after Fitpatrick threw for 247 yards in a Week Three game against [[2010 New England Patriots season|New England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2010/football/nfl/09/27/bills.edwards.ap/index.html?eref=sircrc|title=Buffalo Bills release QB Trent Edwards one week after benching - NFL - SI.com|publisher=Sportsillustrated.cnn.com|date=2010-09-27|accessdate=2010-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jacksonville Jaguars===
Edwards was claimed off waivers by the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]] on September 28. He was the backup quarterback behind [[David Garrard]], and wore jersey #5.

Edwards made his first appearance for the Jaguars on October 18, 2010, against the Tennessee Titans on Monday Night Football, when starting quarterback David Garrard left the game after suffering a concussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Titans vs. Jaguars - Recap

===Oakland Raiders===
After becoming a free agent following the 2010 season, Edwards signed with the [[Oakland Raiders]] on July 30, 2011, and was released on September 3, during the final roster cuts.

===Philadelphia Eagles===
On February 23, 2012, Edwards signed a one-year deal with the [[Philadelphia Eagles]].

Edwards had a disappointing mini camp, and was viewed as a roster filler. However, he started to warm up in training camp, and found his opportunity in the preseason, after [[quarterback]] [[Mike Kafka]] broke his non-throwing hand at the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]. Edwards went 54-of-80 for 489 yards, with four touchdowns and zero [[interceptions]]. The team cut Kafka on August 31, meaning Edwards had won the job as third string quarterback, after the rookie [[Nick Foles]]. Edwards was released on April 15, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosenthal|first=Gregg|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000159996/article/philadelphia-eagles-release-trent-edwards|title=Philadelphia Eagles release Trent Edwards|publisher=[[National Football League]]|date=April 15, 2013|accessdate=April 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chicago Bears===
On August 18, 2013, Edwards was signed by the [[Chicago Bears]] for one year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mayer|first=Larry|url=http://www.chicagobears.com/news/article-1/Bears-add-more-depth-at-quarterback-by-inking-Edwards/ed78ae5f-73d8-41a6-8a48-eb17ebc0dd56|title=Bears add more depth at quarterback by inking Edwards|publisher=[[Chicago Bears]]|date=August 18, 2013|accessdate=August 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edwards had previously worked out with the Bears during the offseason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Crabtree|first=Curtis|url=http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2013/06/05/bears-to-workout-trent-edwards-jordan-palmer-along-with-jamarcus-russell/|title=Bears to workout Trent Edwards, Jordan Palmer along with JaMarcus Russell|publisher=[[Profootballtalk.com]]|date=June 5, 2013|accessdate=August 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was released on August 30, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mayer|first=Larry|url=http://www.chicagobears.com/news/article-1/Bears-cut-17-players-still-have-five-to-go/24b878db-ac76-463c-b766-ef4adfb0ae1c|title=Bears cut 17 players, still have five to go|publisher=[[Chicago Bears]]|date=August 30, 2013|accessdate=August 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second Stint with Raiders===
Edwards was signed by the [[Oakland Raiders]] to a future contract on January 3, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=NBCSports.com|url=http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2014/01/03/raiders-sign-trent-edwards-to-future-contract/|title=Raiders sign Trent Edwards to future contract|first=Curtis|last=Crabtree|date=January 3, 2014|accessdate=2014-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Raiders released Edwards on August 26, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.raiders.com/news/article-1/Raiders-Announce-Transactions/ac64c4f2-843c-4a72-b0f1-e4f3354c27c4 Raiders Announce Transactions]&lt;/ref&gt;
